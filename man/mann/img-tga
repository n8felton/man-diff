NAME
       img-tga - Img, Truevision Targa Format (tga)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::tga  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::tga  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::tga.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in the Truevision Targa Format (tga). More specifically
       img::tga extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is tga.  This handler  provides  new
       additional  configuration  options.  See  section  TGA OPTIONS for more
       detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image data in tga format (options -data and -file)  is  detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  tga  is recognized by the option -format.  In
              addition the value for the option is treated  as  list  and  may
              contain  any  of  the  special  options  listed  in  section TGA
              OPTIONS.

SUPPORTED TGA TYPES
        24-bit pixels: True-color (RGB, each channel 8 bit).
        32-bit pixels: True-color with alpha channel (RGBA, each channel 8 bit).

        List of currently supported features:

        Type   |     Read      |     Write     |
