_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The procedure tk_chooseDirectory pops up a dialog box for the  user  to
       select  a  directory.  The following option-value pairs are possible as
       command line arguments:

       -initialdir dirname
              Specifies that the directories in directory should be  displayed
              when  the  dialog  pops  up. If this parameter is not specified,
              then the directories in the current working directory  are  dis-
              played.  If  the parameter specifies a relative path, the return
              value will convert the relative path to an absolute path.   This
              option may not always work on the Macintosh.  This is not a bug.
              Rather, the General Controls control panel on the Mac allows the
              end user to override the application default directory.

       -parent window
              Makes  window  the  logical  parent of the dialog. The dialog is
              displayed on top of its parent window.

       -title titleString
              Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If
              this  option is not specified, then a default title will be dis-
              played.

       -mustexist boolean
              Specifies whether the user may specify non-existant directories.
              If  this parameter is true, then the user may only select direc-
              tories that already exist.  The default value is false.
