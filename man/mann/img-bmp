NAME
       img-bmp - Img, Windows Bitmap Format (bmp)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::bmp  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::bmp  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::bmp.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in  the  Windows Bitmap Format (bmp). More specifically
       img::bmp extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is bmp.  This handler does not  pro-
       vide additional configuration options.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image  data  in bmp format (options -data and -file) is detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The format name bmp is recognized by the option -format.
