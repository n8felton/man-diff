NAME
       img-sun - Img, Sun Raster Format (sun)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::sun  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::sun  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::sun.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in  the  Sun  Raster  Format  (sun).  More specifically
       img::sun extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is sun.  This handler  provides  new
       additional  configuration  options.  See  section  SUN OPTIONS for more
       detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image data in sun format (options -data and -file)  is  detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  sun  is recognized by the option -format.  In
              addition the value for the option is treated  as  list  and  may
              contain  any  of  the  special  options  listed  in  section SUN
              OPTIONS.
