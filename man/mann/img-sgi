NAME
       img-sgi - Img, SGI Native Format (sgi)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::sgi  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::sgi  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::sgi.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in  the  SGI  Native  Format  (sgi).  More specifically
       img::sgi extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is sgi.  This handler  provides  new
       additional  configuration  options.  See  section  SGI OPTIONS for more
       detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image data in sgi format (options -data and -file)  is  detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  sgi  is recognized by the option -format.  In
              addition the value for the option is treated  as  list  and  may
              contain  any  of  the  special  options  listed  in  section SGI
              OPTIONS.

SUPPORTED SGI TYPES
        24-bit pixels: True-color (RGB, each channel 8 bit).
        32-bit pixels: True-color with alpha channel (RGBA, each channel 8 bit).
        48-bit pixels: True-color (RGB, each channel 16 bit).
        64-bit pixels: True-color with alpha channel (RGBA, each channel 16 bit).

        List of currently supported features:

        Type   |     Read      |     Write     |
               | -file | -data | -file | -data |
        ----------------------------------------
        24-bit | Yes   | Yes*  | Yes   | Yes*  |
        32-bit | Yes   | Yes*  | Yes   | Yes*  |
        48-bit | Yes   | Yes*  | No    | No    |
        64-bit | Yes   | Yes*  | No    | No    |

        *: Implemented by reading/writing from/to a temporary file. This will
           be slow for larger images.

        All images types may be either uncompressed or run-length encoded.


SGI OPTIONS
       The handler provides the following options:

       -verbose bool
              This option is supported for reading and writing.

              If set to true, additional information about  the  loaded/stored
              image is printed to stdout. Default is false.

       -compression type
              This option is supported for writing only.

              Set the compression mode to either none or rle.  Default is rle.

       -matte bool
              This option is supported for reading and writing.

              If set to false, a matte (alpha) channel is ignored during read-
              ing or writing. Default is true.
