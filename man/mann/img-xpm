NAME
       img-xpm - Img, X Windows Pixmap Format (xpm)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::xpm  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::xpm  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::xpm.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in the X Windows Pixmap Format (xpm). More specifically
       img::xpm extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is xpm.  This handler does not  pro-
       vide additional configuration options.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image  data  in xpm format (options -data and -file) is detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The format name xpm is recognized by the option -format.
