img-xbm(n)                                                          img-xbm(n)



NAME
       img-xbm - Img, X Windows Bitmap Format (xbm)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::xbm  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::xbm  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::xbm.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in the X Windows Bitmap Format (xbm). More specifically
       img::xbm extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is xbm.  This handler does not  pro-
       vide additional configuration options.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image  data  in xbm format (options -data and -file) is detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The format name xbm is recognized by the option -format.
