NAME
       tdom  - tdom is an expat parser object extension to create an in-memory
       DOM tree from the input while parsing.

SYNOPSIS
       package require tdom

       set parser [expat]

       tdom $parser enable
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       tdom adds the C handler set "tdom" to an tcl  expat  parser  obj.  This
       handler  set  builds  an in-memory DOM tree out of the input, parsed by
       the parser. A DOM tree created this way behave exactly like a DOM  tree
       created by the "dom" command (see there). In fact, tdom is only another
       interface to the same functionality; it uses the code  behind  the  dom
       code for building the DOM tree.

       tdom parserObj enable


              Adds  the  tdom C handler set to a Tcl expat parser object. Next
              time, the parser parses input, the tdom C handler functions cre-
              ate an in-memory DOM tree.

       tdom parserObj getdoc


              Returns the DOM tree as domDoc (see there) object.

       tdom parserObj setResultEncoding


              See the method setResultEncoding of the dom command.

       tdom parserObj setStoreLineColumn ?boolean?


              See the method setStoreLineColumn of the dom command.

       tdom parserObj remove


              Removes the tdom C handler set from the parser object.

       tdom parserObj keepEmpties


              See the option -keepEmpties of the dom command.
