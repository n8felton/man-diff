DESCRIPTION
       The ::vfs package includes a library of Tcl code, implementing a number
       of different virtual filesystems.  Each of  these  exists  as  its  own
       package,  and  can  be accessed through package require vfs::NAME.  The
       whole set of virtual filesystems is known informally as 'vfslib'


SUPPORTED VFS TYPES
       The current supported types are ftp, tar, http, zip, mk4,  ns,  webdav.
       In  addition  there is the ability to mount any 'urltype' as a new vol-
       ume, provided an appropriate vfs is supported.  This means that you can
       treat evaluate the command

       vfs::urltype::Mount ftp

       for  instance.   Any  access  inside  the  new volume will result in an
       attempt to require a package through  'package  require  vfs::${type}',
       which must therefore exist, or errors will be thrown.


LIMITATIONS
       Most  of the vfs types listed above have not been very well debugged as
       yet.  Please test them!
