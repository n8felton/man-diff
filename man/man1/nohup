NAME

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     The nohup utility invokes command with its arguments and at this time
     sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored.  If the standard output is a termi-
     nal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out in the current
     directory.  If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same
     place as the standard output.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following variable is utilized by nohup.

     HOME  If the output file nohup.out cannot be created in the current
           directory, the nohup utility uses the directory named by HOME to
           create the file.

     126     The utility was found but could not be invoked.

     127     The utility could not be found or an error occurred in nohup.

     Otherwise, the exit status of nohup shall be that of utility.
