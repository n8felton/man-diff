MYSQLIMPORT(1)               MySQL Database System              MYSQLIMPORT(1)



NAME
       mysqlimport - a data import program

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlimport [options] db_name textfile1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqlimport client provides a command-line interface to the LOAD
       DATA INFILE SQL statement. Most options to mysqlimport correspond
       directly to clauses of LOAD DATA INFILE syntax. See Section 12.2.6,
       "LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax".

       Invoke mysqlimport like this:

           shell> mysqlimport [options] db_name textfile1 [textfile2 ...]

       For each text file named on the command line, mysqlimport strips any
       extension from the file name and uses the result to determine the name
       of the table into which to import the file's contents. For example,
       files named patient.txt, patient.text, and patient all would be
       imported into a table named patient.

       mysqldump supports the following options, which can be specified on the
       command line or in the [mysqldump] and [client] option file groups.
       mysqldump also supports the options for processing option files
       described at Section 4.2.3.3.1, "Command-Line Options that Affect
       Option-File Handling".

       o   --help, -?

           Display a help message and exit.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 9.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --columns=column_list, -c column_list

           This option takes a comma-separated list of column names as its
           value. The order of the column names indicates how to match data
           file columns with table columns.

       o   --compress, -C

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           'd:t:o,file_name'. The default is 'd:t:o'.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 9.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --delete, -D

           Empty the table before importing the text file.

       o   --fields-terminated-by=..., --fields-enclosed-by=...,
           --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=..., --fields-escaped-by=...

           These options have the same meaning as the corresponding clauses
           for LOAD DATA INFILE. See Section 12.2.6, "LOAD DATA INFILE
           Syntax".

       o   --force, -f

           Ignore errors. For example, if a table for a text file does not
           exist, continue processing any remaining files. Without --force,
           mysqlimport exits if a table does not exist.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Import data to the MySQL server on the given host. The default host
           is localhost.

       o   --ignore, -i

           See the description for the --replace option.

       o   --ignore-lines=N

           Ignore the first N lines of the data file.

       o   --lines-terminated-by=...

           This option has the same meaning as the corresponding clause for
           LOAD DATA INFILE. For example, to import Windows files that have
           lines terminated with carriage return/linefeed pairs, use
           --lines-terminated-by="\r\n". (You might have to double the
           backslashes, depending on the escaping conventions of your command
           interpreter.) See Section 12.2.6, "LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax".

       o   --local, -L

           Read input files locally from the client host.

       o   --lock-tables, -l

           Lock all tables for writing before processing any text files. This
           ensures that all tables are synchronized on the server.

       o   --low-priority

           Use LOW_PRIORITY when loading the table. This affects only storage
           engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM, MEMORY,
           and MERGE).

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the password value following the
           --password or -p option on the command line, mysqlimport prompts
           for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. See Section 5.3.2.2, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
           allowable values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
           Server".

       o   --replace, -r

           The --replace and --ignore options control handling of input rows
           that duplicate existing rows on unique key values. If you specify
           --replace, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique
           key value. If you specify --ignore, input rows that duplicate an
           existing row on a unique key value are skipped. If you do not
           specify either option, an error occurs when a duplicate key value
           is found, and the rest of the text file is ignored.

       o   --silent, -s

           Silent mode. Produce output only when errors occur.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o   --ssl*

           Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
           server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
           certificates. See Section 5.5.6.3, "SSL Command Options".

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --version, -V

           Display version information and exit.

       Here is a sample session that demonstrates use of mysqlimport:

           shell> mysql -e 'CREATE TABLE imptest(id INT, n VARCHAR(30))' test
           shell> ed
           a
           100     Max Sydow
           101     Count Dracula
           .
           w imptest.txt
           32
           q
           shell> od -c imptest.txt
           0000000   1   0   0  \t   M   a   x       S   y   d   o   w  \n   1   0
           0000020   1  \t   C   o   u   n   t       D   r   a   c   u   l   a  \n
           0000040
           shell> mysqlimport --local test imptest.txt
           test.imptest: Records: 2  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
           shell> mysql -e 'SELECT * FROM imptest' test
           +------+---------------+
           | id   | n             |
           +------+---------------+
           |  100 | Max Sydow     |
           |  101 | Count Dracula |
