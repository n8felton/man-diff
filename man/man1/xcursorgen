XCURSORGEN(1)                                                    XCURSORGEN(1)



NAME
       xcursorgen - create an X cursor file from a collection of PNG images

SYNOPSIS
       xcursorgen [config-file] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Xcursorgen  reads  the  config-file  to  find the list of cursor images
       along with their hotspot and nominal size information.  Xcursorgen con-
       verts  all  of the images to Xcursor format and writes them to the out-
       put-file.

       Each line in the config file is of the form:
       <size> <xhot> <yhot> <filename> <ms-delay>

       Multiple images with the same <size> are used to create  animated  cur-
       sors,  the  <ms-delay> value on each line indicates how long each image
       should be displayed before switching to the next.   <ms-delay>  can  be
       elided for static cursors.
