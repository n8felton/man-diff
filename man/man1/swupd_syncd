swupd_syncd(1)            BSD General Commands Manual           swupd_syncd(1)

NAME
     swupd_syncd -- Software Update Server sync daemon

SYNOPSIS
     swupd_syncd

DESCRIPTION
     Upon invocation, swupd_syncd downloads a list of Software Updates from a
     master server (typically Apple's), then mirrors an administrator-speci-
     fied subset of those updates into the directory /usr/share/swupd/html.
     swupd_syncd is normally invoked by the launchd item com.apple.swup-
     date.sync, where it is configured to check every 12 hours for new
     updates. Once swupd_syncd has completed a check cycle, it terminates.

     Settings controlling the operation of the Software Update Service system
     are stored in the file /etc/swupd/swupd.plist

     Data about packages that should and should not be mirrored is stored in
     the file /etc/swupd/com.apple.server.swupdate.plist
