MYSQL_ZAP(1)                 MySQL Database System                MYSQL_ZAP(1)



NAME
       mysql_zap - kill processes that match a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_zap kills processes that match a pattern. It uses the ps command
       and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

       Invoke mysql_zap like this:

          shell> mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern

       A process matches if its output line from the ps command contains the
       pattern. By default, mysql_zap asks for confirmation for each process.
       Respond y to kill the process, or q to exit mysql_zap. For any other
       response, mysql_zap does not attempt to kill the process.

       If the -signal option is given, it specifies the name or number of the
       signal to send to each process. Otherwise, mysql_zap tries first with
       TERM (signal 15) and then with KILL (signal 9).

       mysql_zap supports the following additional options:

       o  --help, -?, -I

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  -f

          Force mode.  mysql_zap attempts to kill each process without
          confirmation.

       o  -t

          Test mode. Display information about each process but do not kill
          it.
