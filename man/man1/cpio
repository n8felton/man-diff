          name-list [> archive]
     cpio -i [-bBcdfmrsStuvzZ6] [-C bytes] [-E file] [-F archive] [-H format]

DESCRIPTION
     The cpio command copies files to and from a cpio archive.

     The options are as follows:

     -o      Create an archive.  Reads the list of files to store in the ar-
             chive from standard input, and writes the archive on standard
             output.

             -A      Append to the specified archive.

             -a      Reset the access times on files that have been copied to
                     the archive.

             -B      Set block size of output to 5120 bytes.

             -C bytes
                     Set the block size of output to bytes.

             -c      Use ASCII format for cpio header for portability.

             -F archive
                     Use the specified file name as the archive to write to.

             -H format
                     Write the archive in the specified format.  Recognized
                     formats are:

                     bcpio    Old binary cpio format.
                     cpio     Old octal character cpio format.
                     sv4cpio  SVR4 hex cpio format.
                     tar      Old tar format.
                     ustar    POSIX ustar format.

             -L      Follow symbolic links.

             -O archive
                     Use the specified file name as the archive to write to.

             -v      Be verbose about operations.  List filenames as they are
                     written to the archive.

             -Z      Compress archive using compress(1) format.

             -z      Compress archive using gzip(1) format.

     -i      Restore files from an archive.  Reads the archive file from stan-
             dard input and extracts files matching the patterns that were
             specified on the command line.

             -6      Process old-style cpio format archives.

             -B      Set the block size of the archive being read to 5120
                     bytes.

             -b      Do byte and word swapping after reading in data from the
                     archive, for restoring archives created on systems with a
                     different byte order.

             -C bytes
                     Read archive written with a block size of bytes.

             -c      Expect the archive headers to be in ASCII format.

             -d      Create any intermediate directories as needed during
                     restore.

             -E file
                     Read list of file name patterns to extract or list from
                     file.

             -F archive
                     Use the specified file as the input for the archive.

             -f      Restore all files except those matching the patterns
                     given on the command line.

             -H format
                     Read an archive of the specified format.  Recognized for-
                     mats are:

                     bcpio    Old binary cpio format.
                     cpio     Old octal character cpio format.
                     sv4cpio  SVR4 hex cpio format.
                     tar      Old tar format.
                     ustar    POSIX ustar format.

             -I archive
                     Use the specified file as the input for the archive.

             -m      Restore modification times on files.

             -r      Rename restored files interactively.

             -S      Swap words after reading data from the archive.

             -s      Swap bytes after reading data from the archive.

             -t      Only list the contents of the archive, no files or direc-
                     tories will be created.

             -u      Overwrite files even when the file in the archive is
                     older than the one that will be overwritten.

             -v      Be verbose about operations.  List filenames as they are
                     copied in from the archive.

             -Z      Uncompress archive using compress(1) format.

             -z      Uncompress archive using gzip(1) format.

     -p      Copy files from one location to another in a single pass.  The
             list of files to copy are read from standard input and written
             out to a directory relative to the specified directory argument.
             By default, an older file will not replace a newer file with the
             same name.

             -a      Reset the access times on files that have been copied.

             -d      Create any intermediate directories as needed to write
                     the files at the new location.

             -L      Follow symbolic links.

             -l      When possible, link files rather than creating an extra
                     copy.

             -m      Restore modification times on files.

             -u      Overwrite files even when the original file being copied
                     is older than the one that will be overwritten.

             -v      Be verbose about operations.  List filenames as they are
                     copied.

ENVIRONMENT
     TMPDIR      Path in which to store temporary files.

ERRORS
     cpio will exit with one of the following values:

     0   All files were processed successfully.

     1   An error occurred.

     Whenever cpio cannot create a file or a link when extracting an archive
     or cannot find a file while writing an archive, or cannot preserve the
     user ID, group ID, file mode, or access and modification times when the
     -p option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard error
     and a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing will continue.
     In the case where cpio cannot create a link to a file, cpio will not cre-
     ate a second copy of the file.

     If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by
     a signal or error, cpio may have only partially extracted the file the
     user wanted.  Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and direc-
     tories may have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access
     times may be wrong.

     If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or
     error, cpio may have only partially created the archive, which may vio-
     late the specific archive format specification.
