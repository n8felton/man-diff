XSETROOT(1)                                                        XSETROOT(1)



NAME
       xsetroot - root window parameter setting utility for X

SYNOPSIS
       xsetroot  [-help]  [-def]  [-display display] [-cursor cursorfile mask-
       file] [-cursor_name cursorname] [-bitmap filename] [-mod x  y]  [-gray]
       [-grey] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-rv] [-solid color] [-name string]

DESCRIPTION
       The  setroot  program  allows you to tailor the appearance of the back-
       ground ("root") window on a workstation display running  X.   Normally,
       you  experiment  with  xsetroot until you find a personalized look that
       you like, then put the xsetroot command that produces it  into  your  X
       startup  file.   If  no options are specified, or if -def is specified,
       the window is reset to its default state.  The -def option can be spec-
       ified  along with other options and only the non-specified characteris-
       tics will be reset to the default state.

       Only one of  the  background  color/tiling  changing  options  (-solid,
       -gray, -grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be specified at a time.

OPTIONS
       The various options are as follows:

       -help  Print a usage message and exit.

       -def   Reset  unspecified  attributes to the default values.  (Restores
              the background to the familiar gray mesh and the cursor  to  the
              hollow x shape.)

       -cursor cursorfile maskfile
              This  lets  you  change  the pointer cursor to whatever you want
              when the pointer cursor is outside of any  window.   Cursor  and
              mask  files  are bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with
              the bitmap(1) program.  You probably want the mask  file  to  be
              all black until you get used to the way masks work.

       -cursor_name cursorname
              This  lets  you change the pointer cursor to one of the standard
              cursors from the cursor font.  Refer to appendix B of the X pro-
              tocol  for  the  names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided for
              this option).

       -bitmap filename
              Use the bitmap specified in the file to set the window  pattern.
              You  can  make your own bitmap files (little pictures) using the
              bitmap(1) program.  The entire background will  be  made  up  of
              repeated "tiles" of the bitmap.

       -mod x y
              This  is  used  if  you  want  a plaid-like grid pattern on your
              screen.  x and y are integers ranging from 1  to  16.   Try  the
              different  combinations.  Zero and negative numbers are taken as
              1.

       -gray  Make the entire background gray.  (Easier on the eyes.)

       -grey  Make the entire background grey.

       -fg color
              Use ``color'' as the foreground  color.   Foreground  and  back-
              ground  colors  are meaningful only in combination with -cursor,
              -bitmap, or -mod.

       -bg color
              Use ``color'' as the background color.

       -rv    This exchanges the foreground and background  colors.   Normally
              the foreground color is black and the background color is white.

       -solid color
              This sets the background of the root  window  to  the  specified
              color.  This option is only useful on color servers.

       -name string
              Set  the  name  of  the  root window to ``string''.  There is no
              default value.  Usually a name is assigned to a window  so  that
              the window manager can use a text representation when the window
              is iconified.  This option is unused since you can't iconify the
              background.

       -display display
              Specifies the server to connect to; see X(7).
