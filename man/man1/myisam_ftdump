MYISAM_FTDUMP(1)             MySQL Database System            MYISAM_FTDUMP(1)



NAME
       myisam_ftdump - display full-text index information

SYNOPSIS
       myisam_ftdump [options] tbl_name index_num

DESCRIPTION
       myisam_ftdump displays information about FULLTEXT indexes in MyISAM
       tables. It reads the MyISAM index file directly, so it must be run on
       the server host where the table is located

       Invoke myisam_ftdump like this:

          shell> myisam_ftdump [options] tbl_name index_num

       The tbl_name argument should be the name of a MyISAM table. You can
       also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with the .MYI
       suffix). If you do not invoke myisam_ftdump in the directory where the
       table files are located, the table or index file name must be preceded
       by the pathname to the table's database directory. Index numbers begin
       with 0.

       Example: Suppose that the test database contains a table named
       mytexttablel that has the following definition:

          CREATE TABLE mytexttable
          (
            id   INT NOT NULL,
            txt  TEXT NOT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (id),
            FULLTEXT (txt)
          );

       The index on id is index 0 and the FULLTEXT index on txt is index 1. If
       your working directory is the test database directory, invoke
       myisam_ftdump as follows:

          shell> myisam_ftdump mytexttable 1

       If the pathname to the test database directory is
       /usr/local/mysql/data/test, you can also specify the table name
       argument using that pathname. This is useful if you do not invoke
       myisam_ftdump in the database directory:

          shell> myisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1

       myisam_ftdump understands the following options:

       o  --help, -h -?

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --count, -c

          Calculate per-word statistics (counts and global weights).

       o  --dump, -d

          Dump the index, including data offsets and word weights.

       o  --length, -l

          Report the length distribution.

       o  --stats, -s

          Report global index statistics. This is the default operation if no
          other operation is specified.

       o  --verbose, -v

          Verbose mode. Print more output about what the program does.
