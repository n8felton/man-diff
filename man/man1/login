LOGIN(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 LOGIN(1)

NAME
     login -- log into the computer

SYNOPSIS
     login [-pq] [-h hostname] [user]
     login -f [-lpq] [-h hostname] [user [prog [args...]]]

DESCRIPTION
     The login utility logs users (and pseudo-users) into the computer system.

     If no user is specified, or if a user is specified and authentication of
     the user fails, login prompts for a user name.  Authentication of users
     is done via passwords.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      The -f option is used when a user name is specified to indicate
             that proper authentication has already been done and that no
             password need be requested.  This option may only be used by the
             super-user or when an already logged in user is logging in as
             themselves.

             With the -f option, an alternate program (and any arguments) may
             be run instead of the user's default shell.  The program and
             arguments follows the user name.

     -h      The -h option specifies the host from which the connection was
             received.  It is used by various daemons such as telnetd(8).
             This option may only be used by the super-user.

     -l      Tells the program executed by login that this is not a login ses-
             sion (by convention, a login session is signalled to the program
             with a hyphen as the first character of argv[0]; this option dis-
             ables that), and prevents it from chdir(2)ing to the user's home
             directory.  The default is to add the hyphen (this is a login
             session).

     -p      By default, login discards any previous environment.  The -p
             option disables this behavior.

     -q      This forces quiet logins, as if a .hushlogin is present.

     If the file /etc/nologin exists, login dislays its contents to the user
     and exits.  This is used by shutdown(8) to prevent users from logging in
     when the system is about to go down.

     Immediately after logging a user in, login displays the system copyright
     notice, the date and time the user last logged in, the message of the day
     as well as other information.  If the file ``.hushlogin'' exists in the
     user's home directory or -q is specified, all of these messages are sup-
     pressed.  This is to simplify logins for non-human users, such as
     uucp(1).  Login then records an entry in utmpx(5) and the like, and exe-
     cutes the user's command interpreter (or the program specified on the
     command line if -f is specified).

     Login enters information into the environment (see environ(7)) specifying
     the user's home directory (HOME), command interpreter (SHELL), search
     path (PATH), terminal type (TERM) and user name (both LOGNAME and USER).

     The standard shells, csh(1) and sh(1), do not fork before executing the
     login utility.

FILES
     /etc/motd          message-of-the-day
     /etc/nologin       disallows logins
     /var/run/utmpx     current logins
     /var/mail/user     system mailboxes
     .hushlogin         makes login quieter
