NAME
     security_privportserver -- Authorization-based trampoline to acquire
     privileged ports

SYNOPSIS
     security_privportserver

DESCRIPTION
     security_privportserver is used by the Authorization framework call
     AuthorizationBindPrivilegedPort() to allow a process to bind to a privi-
     leged port without requiring the client application to run as root.  The
     tool will acquire the requested ports if the client is granted sys-
     tem.privilege.port.connect and system.privilege.port.accept rights in a
     Security Authorization evaluation.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.

FILES
     /etc/authorization

              The authorization database can be configured to allow or disal-
              low the use of this function.

HISTORY
     security_privportserver was first introduced in Mac OS X version 10.3
     (Panther).
