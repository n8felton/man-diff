RESIZE(1)                                                            RESIZE(1)



NAME
       resize - set TERMCAP and terminal settings to current xterm window size

SYNOPSIS
       resize [ -u | -c ] [ -s [ row col ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Resize prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP environ-
       ment  variables to indicate the current size of xterm window from which
       the command is run.  For this output to take effect, resize must either
       be  evaluated  as  part  of the command line (usually done with a shell
       alias or function) or else redirected to a file which can then be  read
       in.   From the C shell (usually known as /bin/csh), the following alias
       could be defined in the user's .cshrc:

               %  alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

       After resizing the window, the user would type:

               %  rs

       Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as  /bin/sh)  that
       don't  have  command functions will need to send the output to a tempo-
       rary file and the read it back in with the ``.'' command:

               $  resize > /tmp/out
               $  . /tmp/out

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with resize:

       -u      This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be gen-
               erated even if the user's current shell isn't /bin/sh.

       -c      This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated
               even if the user's current shell isn't /bin/csh.

       -s [rows columns]
               This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be
               used  instead  of  the VT100-style xterm escape codes.  If rows
               and columns are given, resize will  ask  the  xterm  to  resize
               itself.  However, the window manager may choose to disallow the
               change.

               Note that the Sun console escape sequences  are  recognized  by
               XFree86  xterm  and  by  dtterm.   The  resize  program  may be
               installed as sunsize, which  causes  makes  it  assume  the  -s
               option.

               The  rows  and  columns arguments must appear last; though they
               are normally associated with the -s  option,  they  are  parsed
               separately.

FILES
       /etc/termcap   for the base termcap entry to modify.

       ~/.cshrc       user's alias for the command.
