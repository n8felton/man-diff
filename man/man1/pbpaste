PBCOPY(1)                                                            PBCOPY(1)



NAME
       pbcopy,  pbpaste  -  provide copying and pasting to the pasteboard (the
       Clipboard) from command line

SYNOPSIS
       pbcopy [-help] [-pboard {general | ruler | find | font}]

       pbpaste [-help] [-pboard {general | ruler  |  find  |  font}]  [-Prefer
       {ascii | rtf | ps}]

DESCRIPTION
       pbcopy  takes  the standard input and places it in the specified paste-
       board. If no pasteboard is specified, the general  pasteboard  will  be
       used  by  default.  The input is placed in the pasteboard as ASCII data
       unless it begins with the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file header  or
       the  Rich  Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is placed in
       the pasteboard as one of those data types.

       pbpaste removes the data from the pasteboard and writes it to the stan-
       dard  output.  It normally looks first for ASCII data in the pasteboard
       and writes that to the standard output; if no  ASCII  data  is  in  the
       pasteboard  it  looks for Encapsulated PostScript; if no EPS if present
       it looks for Rich Text.  If none of  those  types  is  present  in  the
       pasteboard, pbpaste produces no output.

OPTIONS
       -pboard {general | ruler | find | font}
              specifies  which  pasteboard  to  copy  to or paste from.  If no
              pasteboard is given, the general  pasteboard  will  be  used  by
              default.

       -Prefer {ascii | rtf | ps}
              tells  pbpaste  what  type of data to look for in the pasteboard
              first.  As stated above, pbpaste normally looks first for  ASCII
              data;  however, by specifying -Prefer ps you can tell pbpaste to
              look first for Encapsulated PostScript.  If you specify  -Prefer
              rtf,  pbpaste  looks  first  for Rich Text format.  In any case,
              pbpaste looks for the other formats if the preferred one is  not
              found.

BUGS
       There is no way to tell pbpaste to get only a specified data type.
