DESCRIPTION
     The shazam utility offers commands for creating signatures as well as
     processing custom catalogs to build better audio experiences with
     ShazamKit. Current operations supported for a custom catalog include:

     -   Creating a custom catalog from a signature asset file and csv of
         metadata.

     -   Updating an existing custom catalog with a signature asset file and csv
         of metadata.

     -   Exporting the signatures and meta data contents of a custom catalog
         file to disk.

     -   Removing a signature and/or media item entry from a custom catalog
         file.

     -   Displaying the contents of an existing custom catalog file.

OPTIONS
     The options supported by the commands are as follows:


     -h, --help
             Show help information about the command.


     -i,--input input-custom-catalog
             Path to an existing custom catalog file to perform an operation on.


     -i,--input input-media
             Path to an audio or video file to generate a shazam signature from.


     -m,--media-items media-items
             Path to a csv file containing metadata to be associated with a
             shazam signature.


     -m,--media-item-ids media-item-ids
             Comma separated list of media item IDs associated with a signature
             in a custom catalog. Use the display command to display the IDs of
             media items associated with a signature in a custom catalog.


     -o,--output output-custom-catalog
             Path to save a new custom catalog file. If this is a directory a
             new custom catalog file is created in that directory with the same
             name as the signature asset file. For the shazam custom-catalog
             update command, the custom catalog file name will be saved in the
             specified directory with the same name as input-custom-catalog


     -o,--output output-directory
             Path to a directory to export the contents of a custom catalog to.
             Signatures are exported as a .shazamsignature file having the ID of
             the signature as part of the exported file name. Media items are
             exported as a .csv file per shazam signature and have the same ID
             of the signature they are associated with as part of the exported
             file name.


     -o,--output output-signature
             Path to save the new shazam signature. If output-signature is a
             directory, the shazam signature is created in that directory with
             the same name as the input-media file. If output-signature is not
             specified, the shazam signature is saved in the current directory
             with the same name as the input-media file.


     -s,--signature-asset signature-asset
             Path to an audio, video or shazam signature file.


     -s,--signature-id signature-id
             Unique identifier of a signature in a custom catalog. Use the
             display command to display the ID of a signature in a custom
             catalog.


     -v, --verbose
             Show verbose information about the operation.
