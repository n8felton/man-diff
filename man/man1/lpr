NAME
       lpr - print files

SYNOPSIS
       lpr  [  -E  ]  [  -H  server[:port]  ]  [  -U  username ] [ -P destina-
       tion[/instance] ] [ -#  num-copies  [  -h  ]  [  -l  ]  [  -m  ]  [  -o
       option[=value] ] [ -p] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C/J/T title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr  submits  files  for  printing. Files named on the command line are
       sent to the named printer (or the system default destination if no des-
       tination is specified). If no files are listed on the command-line, lpr
       reads the print file from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -C "name"

       -J "name"

       -T "name"
            Sets the job name.

       -P destination[/instance]
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -# copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -h
            Disables banner printing. This option is equivalent  to  "-o  job-
            sheets=none".

       -l
            Specifies  that the print file is already formatted for the desti-
            nation and should be sent without filtering. This option is equiv-
            alent to "-o raw".

       -m
            Send an email on job completion.

       -o option[=value]
            Sets a job option.

       -p
            Specifies  that  the  print file should be formatted with a shaded
            header with the date, time, job name, and page number. This option
            is equivalent to "-o prettyprint" and is only useful when printing
            text files.

       -q
            Hold job for printing.

       -r
            Specifies that the named  print  files  should  be  deleted  after
            printing them.

       The  "c",  "d",  "f",  "g", "i", "n", "t", "v", and "w" options are not
       supported by CUPS and produce a warning message if used.
