NAME
       xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

SYNOPSIS
       xmkmf [ -a ] [ topdir [ curdir ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The xmkmf command is the normal way to create a Makefile from an Imake-
       file shipped with third-party software.

       When invoked with no arguments in a directory containing an  Imakefile,
       the  imake  program  is  run with arguments appropriate for your system
       (configured into xmkmf when X was built) and generates a Makefile.

       When invoked with the -a option, xmkmf builds the Makefile in the  cur-
       rent  directory, and then automatically executes ``make Makefiles'' (in
       case there are subdirectories), ``make includes'', and ``make  depend''
       for  you.  This is the normal way to configure software that is outside
       the X Consortium build tree.

       If working inside the X Consortium build tree (unlikely unless you  are
       an  X  developer,  and even then this option is never really used), the
       topdir argument should be specified as the relative pathname  from  the
       current directory to the top of the build tree.  Optionally, curdir may
       be specified as a relative pathname from the top of the build  tree  to
       the current directory.  It is necessary to supply curdir if the current
       directory has subdirectories, or the Makefile will not be able to build
       the  subdirectories.   If  a  topdir is given, xmkmf assumes nothing is
       installed on your system and looks for files in the build tree  instead
       of using the installed versions.
