NAME
     who -- display who is on the system

SYNOPSIS
     who [-HmqsTu] [am I] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The who utility displays information about currently logged in users.  By
     default, this includes the login name, tty name, date and time of login
     and remote hostname if not local.

     The options are as follows:

     -H      Write column headings above the output.

     -m      Show information about the terminal attached to standard input
             only.

     -q      ``Quick mode'': List the names and number of logged in users in
             columns.  All other command line options are ignored.

     -s      Show the name, line and time fields only.  This is the default.

     -T      Indicate whether each user is accepting messages.  One of the
             following characters is written:

             +  User is accepting messages.
             -  User is not accepting messages.
             ?  An error occurred.

     -u      Show idle time for each user in hours and minutes as hh:mm, `.'
             if the user has been idle less than a minute, and ``old'' if the
             user has been idle more than 24 hours.  Additionally, display the
             PID of the user's login process.

     am I    Equivalent to -m.

     By default, who gathers information from the file /var/run/utmpx.  An
     alternate file may be specified.

LEGACY DESCRIPTION
     In legacy mode, -u does not display the PID of the user's login process.
