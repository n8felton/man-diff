DESCRIPTION
     These are various helper programs that are part of the RubyGems distribu-
     tion, a sophisticated package manager for the Ruby programming language.

     For more information about a specific program, you can use its --help
     flag. There is also online documentation available at
     "http://docs.rubygems.org".

     gem is the main interface to the RubyGems packaging system.

     gem_server is a tool to serve your entire set of installed gems to any-
     one.

     gemlock generates a series of require_gem commands that will lock down an
     application or library to a particular version of their dependent gem.

     gemri acts as a wrapper for the ri(1) command to read gems RI documenta-
     tion.

     gemwhich is a script that behaves like the which(1) command for ruby
     libraries and gem repositories.

     index_gem_repository.rb generates index files for your RubyGems server.

     update_rubygems is an internal script used to update RubyGems.
