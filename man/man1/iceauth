NAME
       iceauth - ICE authority file utility

SYNOPSIS
       iceauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqib ] [ command arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iceauth  program  is  used  to  edit and display the authorization
       information used in connecting with ICE.  This program is usually  used
       to  extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in on
       another (as is the case when using remote logins or granting access  to
       other users).  Commands (described below) may be entered interactively,
       on the iceauth command line, or in scripts.
