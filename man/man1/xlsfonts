NAME
       xlsfonts - server font list displayer for X

SYNOPSIS
       xlsfonts [-display host:dpy] [-l] [-ll] [-lll] [-m] [-C] [-1] [-w
                width] [-n columns] [-u] [-o] [-fn pattern]

       xlsfonts -printer printername [-l] [-ll] [-lll] [-m] [-C] [-1] [-w
                width] [-n columns] [-u] [-o] [-r resolution] [-b] [-B] [-g]
                [-G] [-x mode] [-X mode] [-fn pattern]

DESCRIPTION
       xlsfonts lists the fonts that match the given  pattern.   The  wildcard
       character  "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters (includ-
       ing none), and "?" to match any single character.   If  no  pattern  is
       given, "*" is assumed.

       The  "*"  and  "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from being
       expanded by the shell.

OPTIONS
       -display host:dpy
              This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -printer printername
              This option specifies the Xprint printer to contact.

       -d host:dpy
              Same as -display host:dpy.

       -p printername
              Same as -printer printername.

       -l     Lists some attributes of the font on one line in addition to its
              name.

       -ll    Lists font properties in addition to -l output.

       -lll   Lists character metrics in addition to -ll output.

       -m     This  option  indicates that long listings should also print the
              minimum and maximum bounds of each font.

       -C     This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns.
              This is the same as -n 0.

       -1     This  option indicates that listings should use a single column.
              This is the same as -n 1.

       -w width
              This option specifies the width in  characters  that  should  be
              used  in figuring out how many columns to print.  The default is
              79.

       -n columns
              This option specifies the number of columns to use in displaying
              the  output.  By default, it will attempt to fit as many columns
              of font names into the  number  of  character  specified  by  -w
              width.

       -u     This option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.

       -o     This  option  indicates that xlsfonts should do an OpenFont (and
              QueryFont, if appropriate) rather than  a  ListFonts.   This  is
              useful  if  ListFonts  or ListFontsWithInfo fail to list a known
              font (as is the case with some scaled font systems).

       -r resolutionname
              Set  print  resolution  name  (usually  values  like  300dpi  or
              300x600, see output of xplsprinters).  This may alter the output
              of xlsfonts if there are printer fonts  which  get  enabled/dis-
              abled on per-resolution basis by the DDX.

              (printer mode only)

       -b     List   printer   builtin   fonts.    This  is  the  same  as  -x
              xp-list-internal-printer-fonts.

              (printer mode only)

       -B     Do not list printer builtin fonts.   This  is  the  same  as  -X
              xp-list-internal-printer-fonts.

              (printer mode only)

       -g     List glyph fonts.  This is the same as -x xp-list-glyph-fonts.

              (printer mode only)

       -G     Do   not   list   glyph   fonts.    This   is  the  same  as  -X
              xp-list-glyph-fonts.

              (printer mode only)

       -x mode
              Enable listfont mode mode.

              Supported modes are:

              xp-listinternal-printer-fonts
                     If xp-listinternal-printer-fonts was set (via  option  -b
                     or -x xp-listinternal-printer-fonts xlsfonts will include
                     all of the fonts defined as internal printer fonts.

              xp-list-glyph-fonts
                     If xp-list-glyph-fonts was  set  (via  option  -g  or  -x
                     xp-list-glyph-fonts)  xlsfonts  will  include  all of the
                     fonts available to the server which have  glyphs  associ-
                     ated with them.


       The  default value is implicitly determined by the ddx driver to be the
       all of the listfonts modes  specified  in  the  xp-listfonts-modes-sup-
       ported printer attribute.


       The  value  of xp-listfonts-modes-supported and xp-listfonts-modes (the
       defaults) can be looked-up via xplsprinters(1).


       (printer mode only)

       -X mode
              Disable listfont mode mode.  See option -x for a list  of  valid
              mode values.

              (printer mode only)

       -fn pattern
              This option specifies the font name pattern to match.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
              DISPLAY must be set to get the default host and display to  use.

       XPSERVERLIST
              XPSERVERLIST must be set for the -printer option identifying the
              available Xprint servers.  See Xprint(7) for more details.

BUGS
       Doing ``xlsfonts -l'' can tie up your server  for  a  very  long  time.
       This  is really a bug with single-threaded non-preemptable servers, not
       with this program.
