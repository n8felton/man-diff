NAME
       appleping  -  exercises  the  AppleTalk network by sending packets to a
       named host


SYNOPSIS
       appleping net-node [ packet-size [ npackets ]]

       appleping name:type[@zone] [ packet-size [ npackets ]]


ARGUMENTS
       name:type[@zone]
               Specifies the host by its name, type, and zone. If you  do  not
               specify a value for zone, appleping uses the local zone.

       net-node
               Specifies  the host by its network node number. To see the net-
               work node number for a particular  system,  run  atlookup.  The
               network and node numbers must be in hexadecimal.

       npackets
               Specifies how many packets to send before terminating.

       packet-size
               Specifies  in  bytes  the  size  of  each packet.  The value of
               packet-size must be between 14 and 599. The default packet size
               is 64 bytes.


DESCRIPTION
       appleping  repeatedly  sends AppleTalk Echo Protocol request packets to
       the specified computer and reports whether a reply  was  received.  The
       appleping  command  continues to send packets and to display the result
       until the number of packets specified by npackets is reached  or  until
       you  issue  the  interrupt  character  (usually by pressing CONTROL-C).
       Before exiting, appleping displays a summary of statistics.
