MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)             MySQL Database System            MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)



NAME
       mysql_upgrade - check tables for MySQL upgrade

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_upgrade [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_upgrade examines all tables in all databases for
       incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL Server.
       mysql_upgrade also upgrades the system tables so that you can take
       advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have been added.

       mysql_upgrade should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL. It
       supersedes the older mysql_fix_privilege_tables script, which should no
       longer be used.

       If mysql_upgrade finds that a table has a possible incompatibility, it
       performs a table check and, if problems are found, attempts a table
       repair. If the table cannot be repaired, see Section 2.19.4,
       "Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes" for manual table repair
       strategies.

           Caution
           You should always back up your current MySQL installation before
           performing an upgrade. See Section 6.2, "Database Backup Methods".

           Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before
           you upgrade your MySQL installation and run mysql_upgrade. See
           Section 2.19.1, "Upgrading MySQL", for instructions on determining
           whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and
           how to handle them.

       To use mysql_upgrade, make sure that the server is running, and then
       invoke it like this:

           shell> mysql_upgrade [options]

       After running mysql_upgrade, stop the server and restart it so that any
       changes made to the system tables take effect.

       mysql_upgrade executes the following commands to check and repair
       tables and to upgrade the system tables:

           mysqlcheck --all-databases --check-upgrade --auto-repair
           mysql < fix_priv_tables

       Notes about the preceding commands:

       o   Because mysql_upgrade invokes mysqlcheck with the --all-databases
           option, it processes all tables in all databases, which might take
           a long time to complete. Each table is locked and therefore
           unavailable to other sessions while it is being processed. Check
           and repair operations can be time-consuming, particularly for large
           tables.

       o   For details about what checks the --check-upgrade option entails,
           see the description of the FOR UPGRADE option of the CHECK TABLE
           statement (see Section 12.4.2.3, "CHECK TABLE Syntax").

       o   fix_priv_tables represents a script generated internally by
           mysql_upgrade that contains SQL statements to upgrade the tables in
           the mysql database.

       All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL
       version number. This ensures that next time you run mysql_upgrade with
       the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need
       to check or repair the table again.

       mysql_upgrade also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
       mysql_upgrade_info in the data directory. This is used to quickly check
       whether all tables have been checked for this release so that
       table-checking can be skipped. To ignore this file and perform the
       check regardless, use the --force option.

       If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the
       server and client RPMs.  mysql_upgrade is included in the server RPM
       but requires the client RPM because the latter includes mysqlcheck.
       (See Section 2.12, "Installing MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux".)

       In MySQL 5.0.19, mysql_upgrade was added as a shell script and worked
       only for Unix systems. As of MySQL 5.0.25, mysql_upgrade is an
       executable binary and is available on all systems.

       mysql_upgrade does not upgrade the contents of the help tables. For
       upgrade instructions, see Section 5.1.7, "Server-Side Help".

       mysql_upgrade supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysql_upgrade] and [client] option file
       groups. Other options are passed to mysqlcheck. For example, it might
       be necessary to specify the --password[=password] option.
       mysql_upgrade also supports the options for processing option files
       described at Section 4.2.3.3.1, "Command-Line Options that Affect
       Option-File Handling".

       o   --help

           Display a short help message and exit.

       o   --basedir=path

           The path to the MySQL installation directory. This option is
           accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

       o   --datadir=path

           The path to the data directory. This option is accepted for
           backward compatibility but ignored.

       o   --force

           Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info file and force execution of
           mysqlcheck even if mysql_upgrade has already been executed for the
           current version of MySQL.

       o   --tmpdir=path, -t path

           The path name of the directory to use for creating temporary files.
           This option was added in MySQL 5.0.62.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
           default user name is root.

       o   --verbose

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
