MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)             MySQL Database System            MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)



NAME
       mysql_upgrade - check tables for MySQL upgrade

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_upgrade [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_upgrade should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL. It
       supersedes the older mysql_fix_privilege_tables script, which should no
       longer be used.

       mysql_upgrade checks all tables in all databases for incompatibilities
       with the current version of MySQL Server. If a table is found to have a
       possible incompatibility, it is checked. If any problems are found, the
       table is repaired.  mysql_upgrade also upgrades the system tables so
       that you can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that
       might have been added.

       All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL
       version number. This ensures that next time you run mysql_upgrade with
       the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need
       to check or repair the table again.

       mysql_upgrade also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
       mysql_upgrade_info in the data directory. This is used to quickly check
       if all tables have been checked for this release so that table-checking
       can be skipped. To ignore this file, use the --force option.

       Caution
       Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before you
       upgrade your MySQL installation and run mysql_upgrade. See
       Section 2.18.1, "Upgrading MySQL", for instructions on determining
       whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how
       to handle them.

       mysql_upgrade executes the following commands to check and repair
       tables and to upgrade the system tables.  fix_priv_tables represents a
       script generated interally by mysql_upgrade that contains SQL
       statements to upgrade the tables in the mysql database:

          mysqlcheck --check-upgrade --all-databases --auto-repair
          mysql < fix_priv_tables

       For details about what is checked, see the description of the FOR
       UPGRADE option of the CHECK TABLE statement (see Section 12.5.2.3,
       "CHECK TABLE Syntax").

       In MySQL 5.0.19, mysql_upgrade was added as a shell script and worked
       only for Unix systems. As of MySQL 5.0.25, mysql_upgrade is an
       executable binary and is available on all systems.

       If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the
       server and client RPMs.  mysql_upgrade is included in the server RPM
       but requires the client RPM because the latter includes mysqlcheck.
       (See Section 2.10, "Installing MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux".)

       To use mysql_upgrade, make sure that the server is running, and then
       invoke it like this:

          shell> mysql_upgrade [options]

       After running mysql_upgrade, stop the server and restart it so that any
       changes made to the system tables take effect.

       mysql_upgrade supports the options in the following list. It also reads
       option files (the [mysql_upgrade] and [client] groups) and supports the
       options for processing them described at Section 4.2.3.2.1,
       "Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling". Other options
       are passed to mysqlcheck. For example, it might be necessary to specify
       the --password[=password] option.

       o  --help

          Display a short help message and exit.

       o  --basedir=path

          The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o  --datadir=path

          The path to the data directory.

       o  --force

          Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info file and force execution of mysqlcheck
          even if mysql_upgrade has already been executed for the current
          version of MySQL.

       o  --tmpdir=path, -t path

          The path name of the directory to use for creating temporary files.
          This option was added in MySQL 5.0.62.

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
          default user name is root.

       o  --verbose

          Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
