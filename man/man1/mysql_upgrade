MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)             MySQL Database System            MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)



NAME
       mysql_upgrade - check tables for MySQL upgrade

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_upgrade [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_upgrade should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL. It checks
       all tables in all databases for incompatibilities with the current
       version of MySQL Server. If a table is found to have a possible
       incompatibility, it is checked. If any problems are found, the table is
       repaired.  mysql_upgrade also upgrades the system tables so that you
       can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have
       been added.

       All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL
       version number. This ensures that next time you run mysql_upgrade with
       the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need
       to check or repair the table again.

       mysql_upgrade also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
       mysql_upgrade_info in the data directory. This is used to quickly check
       if all tables have been checked for this release so that table-checking
       can be skipped. To ignore this file, use the --force option.

       Caution
       Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before you
       upgrade your MySQL installation and run mysql_upgrade. See
       Section 4.17, "Upgrading MySQL", for instructions on determining
       whether any such incompatibilies apply to your installation and how to
       handle them.

       To check and repair tables and to upgrade the system tables,
       mysql_upgrade executes the following commands:

          mysqlcheck --check-upgrade --all-databases --auto-repair
          mysql_fix_privilege_tables

       mysql_upgrade supersedes the older mysql_fix_privilege_tables script.
       In MySQL 5.0.19, mysql_upgrade was added as a shell script and worked
       only for Unix systems. As of MySQL 5.0.25, mysql_upgrade is an
       executable binary and is available on all systems. On systems older
       than those supporting mysql_upgrade, you can execute the mysqlcheck
       command manually, and then upgrade your system tables as described in
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables(1).

       If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the
       server and client RPMs.  mysql_upgrade is included in the server RPM
       but requires the client RPM because the latter includes mysqlcheck.
       (See Section 4.9, "Installing MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux".)

       For details about what is checked, see the description of the FOR
       UPGRADE option of the CHECK TABLE statement (see Section 5.2.3, "CHECK
       TABLE Syntax").

       To use mysql_upgrade, make sure that the server is running, and then
       invoke it like this:

          shell> mysql_upgrade [options]

       After running mysql_upgrade, stop the server and restart it so that it
       uses any changes that were made to the system tables.

       mysql_upgrade reads options from the command line and from the
       [mysql_upgrade] group in option files. It supports the options in the
       following list. Other options are passed to mysqlcheck and to
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables. For example, it might be necessary to
       specify the --password[=password] option.

       o  --help

          Display a short help message and exit.

       o  --basedir=path

          The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o  --datadir=path

          The path to the data directory.

       o  --force

          Force execution of mysqlcheck even if mysql_upgrade has already been
          executed for the current version of MySQL. (In other words, this
          option causes the mysql_upgrade_info file to be ignored.)

       o  --tmpdir=path, -t path

          The pathname of the directory to use for creating temporary files.
          This option was added in MySQL 5.0.62.

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server. The default
          username is root.

       o  --verbose

          Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
