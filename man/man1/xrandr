NAME
       xrandr - primitive command line interface to RandR extension

SYNOPSIS
       xrandr [-help]  [-display display] [-o orientation] [-q] [-v] [-s size]
       [-x] [-y] [--screen snum] [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
       Xrandr is used to set the screen size, orientation  and/or  reflection.
       The  -s  option is a small integer index used to specify which size the
       screen should be set to.  To find out what sizes are available, use the
       -q option, which reports the sizes available, the current rotation, and
       the possible rotations and reflections.  The default size is the  first
       size  specified in the list.  The -o option is used to specify the ori-
       entation of the screen, and can be one of "normal inverted left right 0
       1 2 3".

       The -x option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the X axis.
       The -y option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the Y axis.
       Reflection is applied after rotation.

       The  -help  option  prints  out  a usage summary.  The --verbose option
       tells you what xrandr is doing, selects for events, and tells you  when
       events are received to enable debugging.
