ocs(1)                                                                  ocs(1)



NAME
       ocs  -  creates  and  maintains  the database for cscope on a recursive
       directory set

SYNOPSIS
       ocs [-x] [-f] [-q] [-u]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents ocs , a shell  script  wrapper  that
       automates  the  creation  and maintainence of a cscope(1) database on a
       recursive set of directories. Under normal circumstances, ocs generates
       a cscope database on a recursive group of directories starting from the
       current working directory, before launching  cscope(1)  in  interactive
       mode.


OPTIONS
       -x     Enable debugging.

       -f     Force.  Do  not ask about regenerating 'TMP' lists (lists gener-
              ated by ocs ), just do  it;  Allow  the  regeneration  of  'CSD'
              (lists generated by cscope(1) ) lists.

       -q     Tell  cscope  to build a fast reverse index. Database disk space
              usage is doubled, but searching speed is increased.

       -u     Request that the database be updated or regenerated.

FILES
       ./cscope.rc
              If this is an executable shell script, it will  be  included  in
              the body of ocs in order to override intenal filenames and other
              options. See the comments at the top of  /usr/bin/ocs  for  more
              information.

BUGS
       None noted.
