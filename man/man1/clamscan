       --detect-pua
              Detect Possibly Unwanted Applications.

       --exclude-pua=CATEGORY
              Exclude  a specific PUA category. This option can be used multi-
              ple times. See http://www.clamav.net/support/pua  for  the  com-
              plete list of PUA

       --include-pua=CATEGORY
              Only  include  a  specific PUA category. This option can be used
              multiple times. See  http://www.clamav.net/support/pua  for  the
              complete list of PUA

       --detect-structured
              Enable  the  DLP  (Data  Loss  Prevention) module which provides
              detection of SSN and Credit Card numbers.

       --structured-ssn-format=X
              X=0: search for valid SSNs formatted  as  xxx-yy-zzzz  (normal);
              X=1:  search  for  valid SSNs formatted as xxxyyzzzz (stripped);
              X=2: search for both formats. Default is 0.

       --structured-ssn-count=#n
              This option sets the lowest number of  Social  Security  Numbers
              found in a file to generate a detect (default: 3).

       --structured-cc-count=#n
              This  option sets the lowest number of Credit Card numbers found
              in a file to generate a detect (default: 3).

       --no-mail
              Disable scanning of mail files.

       --no-phishing-sigs
              Disable signature-based phishing detection.

       --no-phishing-scan-urls
              Disable url-based heuristic phishing  detection.  This  disables
              Phishing.Heuristics.Email.*

       --heuristic-scan-precedence
              Allow  heuristic  match  to  take precedence. When enabled, if a
              heuristic  scan  (such  as  phishingScan)  detects  a   possible
              virus/phish  it  will  stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves
              CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phish detected by  heuristic
              scans  will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive
              contains both a heuristically detected  virus/phish, and a  real
              malware, the real malware will be reported Keep this disabled if
              you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently  from
              "real"  malware.  If  a non-heuristically-detected virus (signa-
              ture-based) is found first,  the  scan  is  interrupted  immedi-
              ately, regardless of this config option.

       --phishing-ssl
              Always  block  SSL mismatches in URLs (might lead to false posi-
              tives!).

       --phishing-cloak
              Always block cloaked URLs (might lead to some false  positives).

       --no-algorithmic
              In  some  cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files,
              and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide  accurate
              detection. This option disables the algorithmic detection.

       --no-pe
              PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file for-
              mat used in all 32-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By
              default  ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and
              attempts to decompress popular executable packers such  as  UPX,
              Petite,  and  FSG. This option disables PE support and should be
              used with care!

       --no-elf
              Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X exe-
              cutables. This option disables ELF support.

       --no-ole2
              Disable support for Microsoft Office documents and .msi files.

       --no-pdf
              Disable scanning within PDF files.

       --no-html
              Disable support for HTML detection and normalisation.

       --no-archive
              Disable archive support built in libclamav.

       --detect-broken
              Mark broken executables as viruses (Broken.Executable).

       --block-encrypted
              Mark    encrypted    archives    as    viruses   (Encrypted.Zip,
              Encrypted.RAR).

       --mail-follow-urls
              If an email contains URLs ClamAV can  download  and  scan  them.
              WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack. Never
              use it on loaded servers.

       --max-files=#n
              Extract at most #n files from each scanned file (when this is an
              archive,  a  document or another kind of container). This option
              protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 10000)

       --max-filesize=#n
              Extract and scan at most #n kilobytes from each archive. You may
              pass  the  value  in  megabytes in format xM or xm, where x is a
              number. This option protects your  system  against  DoS  attacks
              (default: 25 MB)

       --max-scansize=#n
              Extract  and  scan  at most #n kilobytes from each scanned file.
              You may pass the value in megabytes in format xM or xm, where  x
              is  a  number.  This  option  protects  your  system against DoS
              attacks (default: 100 MB)

       --max-recursion=#n
              Set archive recursion level limit.  This  option  protects  your
              system against DoS attacks (default: 16).

       --max-dir-recursion=#n
              Maximum depth directories are scanned at (default: 15).

EXAMPLES
       (0) Scan a single file:

              clamscan file

       (1) Scan a current working directory:

              clamscan

       (2) Scan all files (and subdirectories) in /home:

              clamscan -r /home

       (3) Load database from a file:

              clamscan -d /tmp/newclamdb -r /tmp

       (4) Scan a data stream:

              cat testfile | clamscan -

       (5) Scan a mail spool directory:

              clamscan -r /var/spool/mail

RETURN CODES
