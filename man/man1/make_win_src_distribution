MAKE_WIN_SRC_DIST(1)         MySQL Database System        MAKE_WIN_SRC_DIST(1)



NAME
       make_win_src_distribution - create source distribution for Windows

SYNOPSIS
       make_win_src_distribution [options]

DESCRIPTION
       make_win_src_distribution creates a Windows source package to be used
       on Windows systems. It is used after you configure and build the source
       distribution on a Unix or Unix-like system so that you have a server
       binary to work with. (See the instructions at Section 4.15.6.5,
       "Creating a Windows Source Package from the Bazaar Repository".)

       Invoke make_win_src_distribution like this from the top-level directory
       of a MySQL source distribution:

          shell> make_win_src_distribution [options]

       make_win_src_distribution understands the following options:

       o  --help

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --debug

          Print information about script operations; do not create a package.

       o  --tmp

          Specify the temporary location.

       o  --suffix

          The suffix name for the package.

       o  --dirname

          Directory name to copy files (intermediate).

       o  --silent

          Do not print verbose list of files processed.

       o  --tar

          Create a tar.gz package instead of a .zip package.

          By default, make_win_src_distribution creates a Zip-format archive
          with the name mysql-VERSION-win-src.zip, where VERSION represents
          the version of your MySQL source tree.
