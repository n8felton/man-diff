quartz-wm(1)                                                      quartz-wm(1)



NAME
       quartz-wm - Aqua Window Manager for the X Window System on OS X

SYNTAX
       quartz-wm [ --only-proxy ]

DESCRIPTION
       quartz-wm  is  a  window  manager  for the X Window System. It provides
       titlebars for X11 windows that aim to match the look and feel of native
       Mac  OS X windows. It also contains functionality to bridge between the
       system pasteboard and the X server's PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD  selections.

OPTIONS
       quartz-wm accepts the following command line options:

       --only-proxy
               This  option  indicates  that the program should not attempt to
               manage any of the  display's  screens.  However  the  selection
               proxying features will still be enabled, meaning that a differ-
               ent window manager may be used, but cut and paste will work  as
               if quartz-wm were running.

CUSTOMIZATION
       quartz-wm  can  be customized using the defaults(1) command. The avail-
       able options are:

       defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm -bool true
               Enables focus-follows-mouse mode. Windows belonging  to  the  X
               server  may then be focused by moving the pointer over them, as
               well as the default mode of clicking in them.

       defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_click_through -bool true
               Disables the default behavior of  swallowing  window-activating
               mouse events.

       defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_limit_size -bool false
               Prevents  the  size of each window being limited to the size of
               the current head.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY This variable is used to determine which X server to use.
