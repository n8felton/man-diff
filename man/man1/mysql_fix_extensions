MYSQL_FIX_EXTENSI(1)         MySQL Database System        MYSQL_FIX_EXTENSI(1)



NAME
       mysql_fix_extensions - normalize table filename extensions

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_fix_extensions data_dir

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_fix_extensions converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM) table
       files to their canonical forms. It looks for files with extensions
       matching any lettercase variant of .frm, .myd, .myi, .isd, and .ism and
       renames them to have extensions of .frm, .MYD, .MYI, .ISD, and .ISM,
       respectively. This can be useful after transferring the files from a
       system with case-insensitive filenames (such as Windows) to a system
       with case-sensitive filenames.

       Invoke mysql_fix_extensions like this, where data_dir is the pathname
       to the MySQL data directory.

          shell> mysql_fix_extensions data_dir
