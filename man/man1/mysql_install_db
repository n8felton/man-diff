MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()                                          MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()



NAME
       mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data directory

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_install_db [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_install_db initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the
       system tables that it contains, if they do not exist.

       To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following syntax:

           shell> mysql_install_db [options]

       Because the MySQL server, mysqld, needs to access the data directory
       when it runs later, you should either run mysql_install_db from the
       same account that will be used for running mysqld or run it as root and
       use the --user option to indicate the user name that mysqld will run
       as. It might be necessary to specify other options such as --basedir or
       --datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the correct locations for
       the installation directory or data directory. For example:

           shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \
                    --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \
                    --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data

       mysql_install_db needs to invoke mysqld with the --bootstrap and
       --skip-grant-tables options (see Section 2.16.2, "Typical configure
       Options"). If MySQL was configured with the --disable-grant-options
       option, --bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables will be disabled. To handle
       this, set the MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the full path
       name of a server that has all options enabled.  mysql_install_db will
       use that server.

       mysql_install_db supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] and (if they are
       common to mysqld) [mysqld] option file groups.

       o   --basedir=path

           The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o   --force

           Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work. In that
           case, grant table entries that normally use host names will use IP
           addresses.

       o   --datadir=path, --ldata=path

           The path to the MySQL data directory.

       o   --rpm

           For internal use. This option is used by RPM files during the MySQL
           installation process.

       o   --skip-name-resolve

           Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant table
           entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.

       o   --srcdir=path

           For internal use. The directory under which mysql_install_db looks
           for support files such as the error message file and the file for
           populating the help tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.32.

       o   --user=user_name

           The login user name to use for running mysqld. Files and
           directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user. You must
           be root to use this option. By default, mysqld runs using your
           current login name and files and directories that it creates will
           be owned by you.

       o   --verbose

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --windows

           For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
           distributions.
