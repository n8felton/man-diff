NAME
       mysqladmin - client for administering a MySQL server

SYNOPSIS
       mysqladmin [options] command [command-options] [command
                                                                                      [command-options]]
                                                                                      ...

DESCRIPTION
       mysqladmin is a client for performing administrative operations. You
       can use it to check the server's configuration and current status, to
       create and drop databases, and more.

       Invoke mysqladmin like this:

          shell> mysqladmin [options] command [command-arg] [command [command-arg]] ...

       mysqladmin supports the commands described in the following list. Some
       of the commands take an argument following the command name.

       o  create db_name

          Create a new database named db_name.

       o  debug

          Tell the server to write debug information to the error log.

       o  drop db_name

          Delete the database named db_name and all its tables.

       o  extended-status

          Display the server status variables and their values.

       o  flush-hosts

          Flush all information in the host cache.

       o  flush-logs

          Flush all logs.

       o  flush-privileges

          Reload the grant tables (same as reload).

       o  flush-status

          Clear status variables.

       o  flush-tables

          Flush all tables.

       o  flush-threads

          Flush the thread cache.

       o  kill id,id,...

          Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there
          must be no spaces in the list.

       o  old-password new-password

          This is like the password command but stores the password using the
          old (pre-4.1) password-hashing format. (See Section 5.5.6.3,
          "Password Hashing in MySQL".)

       o  password new-password

          Set a new password. This changes the password to new-password for
          the account that you use with mysqladmin for connecting to the
          server. Thus, the next time you invoke mysqladmin (or any other
          client program) using the same account, you will need to specify the
          new password.

          If the new-password value contains spaces or other characters that
          are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose it
          within quotes. On Windows, be sure to use double quotes rather than
          single quotes; single quotes are not stripped from the password, but
          rather are interpreted as part of the password. For example:

          shell> mysqladmin password "my new password"

       Caution
       Do not use this command used if the server was started with the
       --skip-grant-tables option. No password change will be applied. This is
       true even if you precede the password command with flush-privileges on
       the same command line to re-enable the grant tables because the flush
       operation occurs after you connect. However, you can use mysqladmin
       flush-privileges to re-enable the grant table and then use a separate
       mysqladmin password command to change the password.

       o  ping

          Check whether the server is alive. The return status from mysqladmin
          is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0 even in
          case of an error such as Access denied, because this means that the
          server is running but refused the connection, which is different
          from the server not running.

       o  processlist

          Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of the
          SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the --verbose option is given, the
          output is like that of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST. (See
          Section 12.5.5.27, "SHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax".)

       o  reload

          Reload the grant tables.

       o  refresh

          Flush all tables and close and open log files.

       o  shutdown

          Stop the server.

       o  start-slave

          Start replication on a slave server.

       o  status

          Display a short server status message.

       o  stop-slave

          Stop replication on a slave server.

       o  variables

          Display the server system variables and their values.

       o  version

          Display version information from the server.


       All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:

          shell> mysqladmin proc stat
          +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
          | Id | User  | Host      | db | Command | Time | State | Info             |
          +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
          | 51 | monty | localhost |    | Query   | 0    |       | show processlist |
          +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
          Uptime: 1473624  Threads: 1  Questions: 39487
          Slow queries: 0  Opens: 541  Flush tables: 1
          Open tables: 19  Queries per second avg: 0.0268

       The mysqladmin status command result displays the following values:

       o  Uptime

          The number of seconds the MySQL server has been running.

       o  Threads

          The number of active threads (clients).

       o  Questions

          The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was
          started.

       o  Slow queries

          The number of queries that have taken more than long_query_time
          seconds. See Section 5.2.4, "The Slow Query Log".

       o  Opens

          The number of tables the server has opened.

       o  Flush tables

          The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the server has
          executed.

       o  Open tables

          The number of tables that currently are open.

       o  Memory in use

          The amount of memory allocated directly by mysqld. This value is
          displayed only when MySQL has been compiled with --with-debug=full.

       o  Maximum memory used

          The maximum amount of memory allocated directly by mysqld. This
          value is displayed only when MySQL has been compiled with
          --with-debug=full.


       If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a local server
       using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits until the server's process
       ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped
       properly.

       mysqladmin supports the options in the following list. It also reads
       option files and supports the options for processing them described at
       Section 4.2.3.2.1, "Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File
       Handling".

       o  --help, -?

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --character-sets-dir=path

          The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 9.2,
          "The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting".

       o  --compress, -C

          Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
          both support compression.

       o  --count=N, -c N

          The number of iterations to make for repeated command execution if
          the --sleep option is given.

       o  --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

          Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
          'd:t:o,file_name'. The default is 'd:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace'.

       o  --default-character-set=charset_name

          Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 9.2, "The
          Character Set Used for Data and Sorting".

       o  --force, -f

          Do not ask for confirmation for the drop db_name command. With
          multiple commands, continue even if an error occurs.

       o  --host=host_name, -h host_name

          Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o  --password[=password], -p[password]

          The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
          short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
          and the password. If you omit the password value following the
          --password or -p option on the command line, you are prompted for
          one.

          Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
          insecure. See Section 5.5.6.2, "End-User Guidelines for Password
          Security".

       o  --pipe, -W

          On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
          applies only for connections to a local server, and only if the
          server supports named-pipe connections.

       o  --port=port_num, -P port_num

          The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o  --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

          The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
          useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
          protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
          allowable values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
          Server".

       o  --relative, -r

          Show the difference between the current and previous values when
          used with the --sleep option. Currently, this option works only with
          the extended-status command.

       o  --silent, -s

          Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be established.

       o  --sleep=delay, -i delay

          Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for delay seconds in between.
          The --count option determines the number of iterations. If --count
          is not given, mysqladmin executes commands indefinitely until
          interrupted.

       o  --socket=path, -S path

          For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
          Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o  --ssl*

          Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
          server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates.
          See Section 5.5.7.3, "SSL Command Options".

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o  --verbose, -v

          Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o  --version, -V

          Display version information and exit.

       o  --vertical, -E

          Print output vertically. This is similar to --relative, but prints
          output vertically.

       o  --wait[=count], -w[count]

          If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of
          aborting. If a count value is given, it indicates the number of
          times to retry. The default is one time.


       You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value The
       --set-variable format is deprecated. syntax:

       o  connect_timeout

          The maximum number of seconds before connection timeout. The default
          value is 43200 (12 hours).

       o  shutdown_timeout

          The maximum number of seconds to wait for server shutdown. The
          default value is 3600 (1 hour).


       It is also possible to set variables by using --var_name=value. The
       --set-variable format is deprecated.
