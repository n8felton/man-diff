MYSQL.SERVER(1)              MySQL Database System             MYSQL.SERVER(1)



NAME
       mysql.server - MySQL server startup script

SYNOPSIS
       mysql {start|stop}

DESCRIPTION
       MySQL distributions on Unix include a script named mysql.server. It can
       be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris that use System V-style
       run directories to start and stop system services. It is also used by
       the Mac OS X Startup Item for MySQL.

       mysql.server can be found in the support-files directory under your
       MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source distribution.

       If you use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm), the
       mysql.server script will be installed in the /etc/init.d directory with
       the name mysql. You need not install it manually. See Section 2.10,
       "Installing MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux", for more information on
       the Linux RPM packages.

       Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script under a
       different name such as mysqld.

       If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary
       distribution format that does not install mysql.server automatically,
       you can install it manually. Instructions are provided in
       Section 2.17.2.2, "Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically".

       mysql.server reads options from the [mysql.server] and [mysqld]
       sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also reads
       [mysql_server] sections, although you should rename such sections to
       [mysql.server] when using MySQL 5.0.

       mysql.server supports the following options.

       o   --basedir=path

           The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o   --datadir=path

           The path to the MySQL data directory.

       o   --pid-file=file_name

           The path name of the file in which the server should write its
           process ID.

       o   --service-startup-timeout=file_name

           How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server startup. If
           the server does not start within this time, mysql.server exits with
           an error. The default value is 900. A value of 0 means not to wait
           at all for startup. Negative values mean to wait forever (no
           timeout). This option was added in MySQL 5.0.40. Before that, a
           value of 900 is always used.

       o   --use-mysqld_safe

           Use mysqld_safe to start the server. This is the default. This
           option was added in MySQL 5.0.4.

       o   --use-manager

           Use Instance Manager to start the server. This option was added in
           MySQL 5.0.4.

       o   --user=user_name

           The login user name to use for running mysqld. This option was
           added in MySQL 5.0.4.
