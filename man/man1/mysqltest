MYSQLTEST(1)                 MySQL Database System                MYSQLTEST(1)



NAME
       mysqltest - program to run test cases
       mysqltest_embedded - program to run embedded test cases

SYNOPSIS
       mysqltest [options] [db_name]

       mysqltest_embedded [options] [db_name]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqltest program runs a test case against a MySQL server and
       optionally compares the output with a result file. This program reads
       input written in a special test language. Typically, you invoke
       mysqltest via mysql-test-run.pl rather than invoking it directly.

       mysqltest_embedded is similar but is built with support for the
       libmysqld embedded server.

       Features of mysqltest:

       o  Can send SQL statements to MySQL servers for execution

       o  Can execute external shell commands

       o  Can test whether the result from an SQL statement or shell command
          is as expected

       o  Can connect to one or more standalone mysqld servers and switch
          between connections

       o  Can connect to an embedded server (libmysqld), if MySQL is compiled
          with support for libmysqld. (In this case, the executable is named
          mysqltest_embedded rather than mysqltest.)


By default, mysqltest reads the test case on the standard input. To run
mysqltest this way, you normally invoke it like this:

   shell> mysqltest [options] [db_name] < test_file

You can also name the test case file with a --test-file=file_name option.

The exit value from mysqltest is 0 for success, 1 for failure, and 62 if it
skips the test case (for example, if after checking some preconditions it
decides not to run the test).

mysqltest supports the following options:

o  --help, -?

   Display a help message and exit.

o  --basedir=dir_name, -b dir_name

   The base directory for tests.

o  --big-test, -B

   Define the mysqltest variable $BIG_TEST as 1. This option was removed in
   MySQL 4.1.23, 5.0.30, and 5.1.13.

o  --character-sets-dir=path

   The directory where character sets are installed. This option was added in
   MySQL 4.1.23, 5.0.32, and 5.1.13.

o  --compress, -C

   Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both
   support compression.

o  --cursor-protocol

   Use cursors for prepared statements (implies --ps-protocol). This option
   was added in MySQL 5.0.19.

o  --database=db_name, -D db_name

   The default database to use.

o  --debug[=debug_options], -#[debug_options]

   Write a debugging log if MySQL is built with debugging support. The default
   debug_options value is 'd:t:S:i:O,/tmp/mysqltest.trace'.

o  --debug-check

   Print some debugging information when the program exits. This option was
   added in MySQL 5.1.21.

o  --debug-info

   Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the
   program exits. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.

o  --host=host_name, -h host_name

   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

o  --include=file_name, -i file_name

   Include the contents of the given file before processing the contents of
   the test file. The included file should have the same format as other
   mysqltest test files. This option has the same effect as putting a --source
   file_name command as the first line of the test file. This option was added
   in MySQL 4.1.23, 5.0.30, and 5.1.7.

o  --logdir=dir_name

   The directory to use for log files. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.

o  --mark-progress

   Write the line number and elapsed time to test_file.progress. This option
   was added in MySQL 4.1.23, 5.0.30, and 5.1.12.

o  --max-connect-retries=num

   The maximum number of connection attempts when connecting to server. This
   option was added in MySQL 4.1.23, 5.0.23, and 5.1.11.

o  --no-defaults

   Do not read default options from any option files.

o  --password[=password], -p[password]

   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short
   option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option and the
   password. If you omit the password value following the --password or -p
   option on the command line, you are prompted for one.

o  --port=port_num, -P port_num

   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

o  --ps-protocol

   Use the prepared-statement protocol for communication.

o  --quiet

   Suppress all normal output. This is a synonym for --silent.

o  --record, -r

   Record the output that results from running the test file into the file
   named by the --result-file option, if that option is given.

o  --result-file=file_name, -R file_name

   This option specifies the file for test case expected results.
   --result-file, together with --record, determines how mysqltest treats the
   test actual and expected results for a test case:

   o  If the test produces no results, mysqltest exits with an error message
      to that effect.

   o  Otherwise, if --result-file is not given, mysqltest sends test results
      to the standard output.

   o  With --result-file but not --record, mysqltest reads the expected
      results from the given file and compares them with the actual results.
      If the results do not match, mysqltest writes a .reject file in the same
      directory as the result file and exits with an error.

   o  With both --result-file and --record, mysqltest updates the given file
      by writing the actual test results to it.

o  --server-arg=value, -A value

   Pass the argument as an argument to the embedded server. For example,
   --server-arg=--tmpdir=/tmp or --server-arg=--core. Up to 64 arguments can
   be given.

o  --server-file=file_name, -F file_name

   Read arguments for the embedded server from the given file. The file should
   contain one argument per line.

o  --silent, -s

   Suppress all normal output.

o  --skip-safemalloc

   Do not use memory allocation checking.

o  --sleep=num, -T num

   Cause all sleep commands in the test case file to sleep num seconds. This
   option does not affect real_sleep commands.

   As of MySQL 5.0.23, an option value of 0 can be used, which effectively
   disables sleep commands in the test case.

o  --socket=path, -S path

   The socket file to use when connecting to localhost (which is the default
   host).

o  --sp-protocol

   Execute DML statements within a stored procedure. For every DML statement,
   mysqltest creates and invokes a stored procedure that executes the
   statement rather than executing the statement directly. This option was
   added in MySQL 5.0.19.

o  --test-file=file_name, -x file_name

   Read test input from this file. The default is to read from the standard
   input.

o  --timer-file=file_name, -m file_name

   The file where the timing in microseconds is written.

o  --tmpdir=dir_name, -t dir_name

   The temporary directory where socket files are put.

o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

o  --verbose, -v

   Verbose mode. Print out more information what the program does.

o  --version, -V

   Display version information and exit.

o  --view-protocol

   Every SELECT statement is wrapped inside a view. This option was added in
   MySQL 5.0.19.
