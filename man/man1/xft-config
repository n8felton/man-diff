xft-config(1)                                                    xft-config(1)



NAME
       xft-config  - report Xft version, compiler, linker, and/or installation
       directory information

SYNOPSIS
       xft-config { --exec-prefix[=local_prefix] |  --prefix[=local_prefix]  |
       --cflags | --libs } ...

       xft-config --version

DESCRIPTION
       xft-config  reports  information  of  interest  to users and developers
       about the installed version of the X FreeType library, Xft(3).  Depend-
       ing  on  how it is invoked, xft-config reports the installed version of
       Xft, the compiler and linker flags that are  required  to  successfully
       compile and link C (or C-compatible) code that uses the library, and/or
       the directories used by the GNU Autotools to install its  files.   Note
       that if the system's installed version of Xft came from an OS vendor or
       other third party, the actual location of its  files  may  differ  from
       those  reported  by xft-config.  The system adminstrator can also relo-
       cate Xft's files.

       If invoked without any arguments, xft-config will print a usage message
       on standard error and exit.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Report the compiler flags that are required to compile code that
              uses Xft symbols.

       --exec-prefix[=local_prefix]
              If specified without the parameter local_prefix, report the file
              specification  prefix  that  Xft  uses  for installation of exe-
              cutable files.  If local_prefix is specified, it is used instead
              of  the  file specification prefix used for installation of exe-
              cutable files by Xft and the value of the option argument speci-
              fied  with  --prefix,  if any, when compile and linker flags are
              reported (with --cflags and --libs, respectively).

       --libs Report the linker flags that are required to link code that uses
              Xft symbols.

       --prefix[=local_prefix]
              If specified without the parameter local_prefix, report the file
              specification prefix that Xft uses for  installation  of  files.
              If  local_prefix  is  specified,  it is used instead of the file
              specification prefix used for installation of files by Xft  when
              compile and linker flags are reported (with --cflags and --libs,
              respectively); also see --exec-prefix.

       --version
              Report the version of the Xft library installed  on  the  system
              and exit.

OPERANDS
       xft-config  does  not recognize any non-option arguments.  At least one
       option must be specified.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Information was successfully reported.

       1      xft-config was invoked with invalid arguments, or  no  arguments
              at all.
