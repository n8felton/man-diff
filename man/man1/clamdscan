Clamd client(1)                 Clam AntiVirus                 Clamd client(1)



NAME
       clamdscan - scan files and directories for viruses using Clam AntiVirus
       Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       clamdscan [options] [file/directory]

DESCRIPTION
       clamdscan is a clamd client which may be used as  a  clamscan  replace-
       ment.  It  accepts  all the options implemented in clamscan but most of
       them will be ignored because its  scanning  abilities  only  depend  on
       clamd.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       --quiet
              Be quiet - only output error messages.

       --stdout
              Write all messages (except for libclamav output) to the standard
              output (stdout).

       --config-file=FILE
              Read clamd settings from FILE.

       -l FILE, --log=FILE
              Save the scan report to FILE.

       -f FILE, --file-list=FILE
              Scan files listed line by line in FILE.

       -m, --multiscan
              In multiscan mode several files are scanned in parallel, one for
              each  available  scan  thread in clamd.  This is achieved either
              via MULTISCAN or IDSESSION requests, depending on the configura-
              tion  and  other  options.   Can  be combined with --fdpass (see
              below)

       --remove
              Remove infected files. Be careful.

       --move=DIRECTORY
              Move infected files into DIRECTORY.

       --no-summary
              Do not display summary at the end of scanning.

       --reload
              Request clamd to reload virus database.

       --fdpass
              Pass the file descriptor permissions to clamd. This is useful if
              clamd  is  running  as  a  different  user  as it is faster than
              streaming the file to clamd.  Only  available  if  connected  to
              clamd via local(unix) socket.

       --stream
              Forces  file streaming to clamd. This is generally not needed as
              clamdscan detects automatically if streaming is  required.  This
              option  only  exists  for debugging and testing purposes, in all
              other cases --fdpass is preferred.

EXAMPLES
       (0) To scan a one file:

              clamdscan file

       (1) To scan a current working directory:

              clamdscan

       (2) To scan all files in /home:

              clamdscan /home

       (3) To scan a file when clamd is running as a different user:

              clamdscan --fdpass ~/downloads

       (4) To scan from standard input:

              clamdscan - <file_to_scan cat file_to_scan | clamdscan -

RETURN CODES
       0 : No virus found.

       1 : Virus(es) found.

       2 : An error occured.
