Clamd client(1)                 Clam AntiVirus                 Clamd client(1)



NAME
       clamdscan - scan files and directories for viruses using Clam AntiVirus
       Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       clamdscan [options] [file/directory]

DESCRIPTION
       clamdscan is a simple clamd client which may  be  used  as  a  clamscan
       replacement.  It  accepts  all  the options implemented in clamscan but
       most of them will be ignored because its scanning abilities only depend
       on clamd.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       --quiet
              Be quiet - only output error messages.

       --stdout
              Write all messages (except for libclamav output) to the standard
              output (stdout).

       --config-file=FILE
              Read clamd settings from FILE.

       -l FILE, --log=FILE
              Save the scan report to FILE.

       -m, --multiscan
              Always use MULTISCAN instead of CONTSCAN.

       --remove
              Remove infected files. Be careful.

       --move=DIRECTORY
              Move infected files into DIRECTORY.

       --no-summary
              Do not display summary at the end of scanning.

       --fdpass
              Pass the file descriptor permissions clamd. This  is  useful  if
              clamd  is  running  as  a  different  user  as it is faster than
              streaming the file to clamd.  Only  available  if  connected  to
              clamd through local(unix) sockets and scanning stdin.

EXAMPLES
       (0) To scan a one file:

              clamdscan file

       (1) To scan a current working directory:

              clamdscan

       (2) To scan all files in /home:

              clamdscan /home

       (3) To scan a file when clamd is running as a different user:

              clamdscan - <file_to_scan

RETURN CODES
       0 : No virus found.

       1 : Virus(es) found.

       2 : An error occured.
