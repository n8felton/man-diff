servertool(1)                                                    servertool(1)



NAME
       servertool - The Java(TM) IDL Server Tool

       servertool  provides  an ease-of-use interface for application program-
       mers to register, unregister, startup and shutdown a server.

SYNOPSIS
       servertool -ORBInitialPort nameserverport options { commands ]

       If you did not enter a command when starting servertool,  the  command-
       line  tool  displays  with a servertool > prompt. Enter commands at the
       servertool > prompt.

       If you enter a command when starting servertool, the  Java  IDL  Server
       Tool starts, runs the command, and exits.

       The  -ORBInitialPort  nameserverport option is required.  The value for
       nameserverport must specify the port on which orbd is running and  lis-
       tening  for  incoming  requests.  When using Solaris software, you must
       become root to start a process on a port under 1024. For  this  reason,
       we  recommend  that you use a port number greater than or equal to 1024
       for the nameserverport.

DESCRIPTION
       The servertool provides the command-line interface for the  application
       programmers  to  register,  unregister, startup, and shutdown a server.
       Other commands are provided to obtain various  statistical  information
       about the server.

OPTIONS
       -ORBInitialHost  nameserverhost
              Specifies  the  host machine on which the name server is running
              and listening for incoming requests. The nameserverhost defaults
              to  localhost  if  this  option  is  not  specified. If orbd and
              servertool are running on different machines, you  must  specify
              the name or IP address of the host on which orbd is running.

       -Joption
              Pass  option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one of
              the options described on the reference page for the java  appli-
              cation launcher.  For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory
              to 48 megabytes. It is  a  common  convention  for  -J  to  pass
              options to the underlying virtual machine.

COMMANDS
       register -server <server class name>
              -classpath  <classpath  to server> [ -applicationName <alternate
              server name> -args <args to server> -vmargs <flags to be  passed
              to Java VM> ]

              Register  a  new  server  with  the Object Request Broker Daemon
              (ORBD).  If the server is not already registered, it  is  regis-
              tered  and  activated.  This command causes an install method to
              be invoked in the main class of the  server  identified  by  the
              -server  option.  The  install method must be public static void
              install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB).  The install method is optional  and
              enables  the  developer to provide their own server installation
              behavior (for example, creating database schema).

       unregister -serverid <server id >
              | -applicationName <name>

              Unregister a server from the ORBD by using either its server  id
              or  its  application  name.   This  command  causes an uninstall
              method to be invoked in the main class of the server  identified
              by  the  -server  option.  The  uninstall  method must be public
              static void uninstall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The  uninstall  method
              is  optional  and  enables  the  developer  to provide their own
              server uninstall behavior (for example, undoing the behavior  of
              the install method).

       getserverid -applicationName <application name>
              Return the server id that corresponds with an application.

       list
              List  all  information  about  all persistent servers registered
              with the ORBD.

       listappnames
              List the application names for all server  currently  registered
              with the ORBD.

       listactive
              List all information about all persistent servers that have been
              launched by the ORBD and are currently running.

       locate -serverid <server id> | -applicationName <application name>
              [-endpointType <endpointType> ]

              Locate the endpoints (ports) of a specific  type  for  all  ORBs
              created  by a registered server. If a server is not already run-
              ning, it is activated. If an endpoint  type  is  not  specified,
              then  the  plain/non-protected endpoint associated with each ORB
              in a server is returned.

       locateperorb -serverid <server id>  |  -application  Name  <application
       name> ]
              [-orbid <ORB name> ]

              Locate all the endpoints (ports) registered by a specific ORB of
              registered  server.  If a server is not already running, then it
              is activated. If an orbid is not specified, the default value of
              ""  is  assigned  to the orbid.  If any ORBs are created with an
              orbid of empty string, all ports registered by it are  returned.

       orblist -serverid <server id> |
              -applicationName <application name> ]

              Lists  the  ORBId  of the ORBs defined on a server.  An ORBId is
              the string name for the ORB created by the server. If the server
              is not already running, it is activated.

       shutdown -serverid <server id> |
              -applicationName <application name> ]

              Shutdown an  active server that is registered with ORBD.  During
              execution of this command, the shutdown() method defined in  the
              the  class specified by either the -serverid or -applicationName
              parameter is also invoked to shutdown the server process  appro-
              priately.

       startup -serverid <server id> |
              -applicationName <application name>

              Startup  or  activate a server that is registered with ORBD.  If
              the server is not running, this command launches the server.  If
              the  server  is already running, an error message is returned to
              the user.

       help
              List all the commands available to the server through the server
              tool.

       quit
              Exit the server tool.
