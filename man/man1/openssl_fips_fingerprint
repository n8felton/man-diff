openssl_fips_fingerprint(1)         OpenSSL        openssl_fips_fingerprint(1)



NAME
       openssl_fips_fingerprint - OpenSSL FIPS Fingerprint tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl_fips_fingerprint libcrypto application

DESCRIPTION
       openssl_fips_fingerprint  checks  the  SHA-1  HMAC  fingerprint  of the
       passed libcrypto (which should be the one the  passed  application  was
       linked  against).   If  the fingerprint is correct openssl_fips_finger-
       print generates a digest of the application in  its  parent  directory.
       This digest will be checked by the application's FIPS functions at run-
       time.  If the digest does not match, FIPS_mode_set() will fail.
