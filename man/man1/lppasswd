NAME
       lppasswd - add, change, or delete digest passwords.

SYNOPSIS
       lppasswd [ username ]
       lppasswd -a [ -g groupname ] username
       lppasswd -x username

DESCRIPTION
       lppasswd  adds,  changes, or deletes passwords in the CUPS digest pass-
       word file, passwd.md5. When run by a normal user, lppasswd will  prompt
       for  the  old  and new passwords.  When run by the super-user, lppasswd
       can add new accounts (-a username),  change  existing  accounts  (user-
       name),  or  delete  accounts (-x username) in the digest password file.
       Digest usernames do not have to match local UNIX usernames.

OPTIONS
       lppasswd supports the following options:

       -g groupname
            Specifies a group other than the default system group.

SECURITY ISSUES
       The lppasswd command is installed setuid to root. While  every  attempt
       has  been  made  to  make  it  secure against exploits that could grant
       super-user privileges to unprivileged users, paranoid  system  adminis-
       trators  may  wish to disable or change the ownership of the program to
       an unprivileged account.
