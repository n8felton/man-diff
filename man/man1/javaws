NAME
       javaws - Java Web Start command launcher

SYNOPSIS
       javaws [ [ options ] ]   [ URL ]

PARAMETERS
       Options may be in any order. For a discussion of a specific option, see
       OPTIONS below.

       options
             Command-line options. See OPTIONS below.

       URL   Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the JNLP (Java Network  Launch-
             ing Protocol) file.


       The  javaws  command  launches  Java  Web Start, which is the reference
       implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP).  Java Web
       Start launches Java application/applets hosted on a network.

       Without  any  options  javaws  will  launch  the Java Application Cache
       Viewer.

       If a URL specifying a JNLP (Java Network Launching  Protocol)  file  is
       specified,  javaws will launch the Java application/applet specified in
       the JNLP file.

OPTIONS
       The javaws launcher has a set of options that are supported in the cur-
       rent release.  However, the options may be removed in a future release.
       All -X options are non-standard and subject to change.

       -offline
             Runs Java Web Start in offline mode.

       -Xclearcache
             Clears the user's cache.  Java Web Start will exit after the com-

       -uninstall URL
             Removes  a  specific application/applet from the user's cache, as
             indicated by the URL for the JNLP file. Java Web Start will  exit
             after the command has completed.

       -import
             Imports  the  application  specified  by  the URL into the user's
             cache (without running it)

       -silent
             Iimports in silent mode, when used with --import (ie. no UI  will
             be displayed).

       -codebase URL
             Replaces the codebase with URL
              (URL   must  be valid) in the JNLP file specified when importing
             the resources.

       -system
             Uses the system cache instead of the user cache.

       -shortcut
             Allows the creation of shortcuts during silent import.

       -association
             Allows the creation of associations during silent import.

       -open arguments
             Replaces the arguments in the JNLP file with "-open arguments".

       -print arguments
             Replaces the arguments in the JNLP file with "-print  arguments".

       -userConfig property-name
             Clears the specified deployment property
              property-name. Java Web Start will then exit.

       -userConfig  property-name property-value
             Sets  the  specified  deployment  property-name  to the specified
             property-value. Java Web Start will then exit.

       -updateVersions
             Updates the Java Web Start configuration file based on  the  cur-
             rent machine's settings. Java Web Start will then exit.

       -Xnosplash
             Disable the display of the initial splash screen.

       -viewer
             Runs  the  Java  Application  Cache  Viewer (default if no URL is
             specified).
