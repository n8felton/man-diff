RLOGIN(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                RLOGIN(1)

NAME
     rlogin -- remote login

SYNOPSIS
     rlogin [-8ELd] [-e char] [-k realm] [-l username] host
     rlogin [-8ELd] [-e char] username@host

DESCRIPTION
     Rlogin starts a terminal session on a remote host host.

     Rlogin first attempts to use the standard Berkeley rhosts authorization
     mechanism.  The options are as follows:

     -8    The -8 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
           otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's
           stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q .

     -E    The -E option stops any character from being recognized as an
           escape character.  When used with the -8 option, this provides a
           completely transparent connection.

     -L    The -L option allows the rlogin session to be run in ``litout''
           (see tty(4)) mode.

     -d    The -d option turns on socket debugging (see setsockopt(2)) on the
           TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.

     -e    The -e option allows user specification of the escape character,
           which is ``~'' by default.  This specification may be as a literal
           character, or as an octal value in the form \nnn.

     A line of the form ``<escape char>.'' disconnects from the remote host.
     Similarly, the line ``<escape char>^Z'' will suspend the rlogin session,
     and ``<escape char><delayed-suspend char>'' suspends the send portion of
     the rlogin, but allows output from the remote system.  By default, the
     tilde (``~'') character is the escape character, and normally control-Y
     (``^Y'') is the delayed-suspend character.

     All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
     the rlogin is transparent.  Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input
     and output on interrupts are handled properly.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable is utilized by rlogin:

     TERM  Determines the user's terminal type.

HISTORY
     The rlogin command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     More of the environment should be propagated.
