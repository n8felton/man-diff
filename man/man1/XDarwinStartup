NAME
       XDarwinStartup - Startup program for the XDarwin X window server

SYNOPSIS
       XDarwinStartup  [-iokit]  [-fullscreen]  [-rootless]  [-quartz] [-idle]
       [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The XDarwin(1) X window server can be run in  a  variety  of  different
       modes  and  is  actually two different executables. The IOKit X server,
       XDarwin, is used when running from the console.  It  is  most  commonly
       located  in  __XBinDir__.  The Quartz X server, for running in parallel
       with Aqua, is a full-fledged Mac OS X application that can  be  started
       from  the Finder. Its application bundle is XDarwin.app, which is typi-
       cally located in /Applications.  XDarwinStartup allows  easy  switching
       between  these  X  servers and auto-detection of the appropriate one to
       use when launching from the command line.  When run without  any  argu-
       ments, XDarwinStartup will start the Quartz X server if the Core Graph-
       ics window server is currently running. Otherwise  it  will  start  the
       IOKit X server.

       To locate the Quartz X server, XDarwinStartup will try to read the soft
       link at __XBinDir__/XDarwinQuartz.  This is typically a  soft  link  to
       the  executable of the XDarwin.app application. If this fails, XDarwin-
       Startup will call Launch Services to locate XDarwin.app.

       To start the IOKit X server, XDarwinStartup will run the  XDarwin  exe-
       cutable, which should be present in the user's path.

OPTIONS
       XDarwinStartup  accepts  and  passes  on all options to the X server it
       launches. In addition the following options have specific effects:

       -iokit  Launch the IOKit X server.

       -fullscreen
               Launch the Quartz X server to run in full screen mode.

       -rootless
               Launch the Quartz X server to run in rootless mode.

       -quartz Launch the Quartz X server.

       -idle   Pause and do nothing. This option is used by  XDarwin.app  when
               it is started from the Finder.
