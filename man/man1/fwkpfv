fwkpfv(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                fwkpfv(1)

NAME
     fwkpfv -- FireWire kprintf viewer

SYNOPSIS
     fwkpfv [-o] [-c] [-n] [-i]

DESCRIPTION
     Use fwkpfv to receive FireWire kprintf logging. FireWireKPrintf redirects
     "kprintf()" logging to FireWire. Kernel printfs or "kprintfs" are used by
     many kernel services as a low level logging mechanism. They can also be
     used in third party kernel extensions. FireWire kprintfs are available
     very early in the kernel's startup and right until the cpu is powered
     down at sleep, restarted, or shutdown. Similarly, they are available
     almost as soon as the cpu is powered when waking. They can be useful for
     debugging kernel code (including KEXTs), particularly sleep/wake issues
     where the display and/or ethernet is unavailable.

OPTIONS
     The available options are as follows:

     -o     Append output logging to /Library/Logs/FireWireKPrintf.log.

     -c     Open log file with Console.app. Only valid with "-o".

     -n     Create a new log file, rather than append. Only valid with "-o".

     -i     Prefix target machine's ID to each log.

FILES
     /usr/bin/fwkpfv
             is installed as part of the Mac OS X Developer Tools.
