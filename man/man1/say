NAME
       say - Convert text to audible speech

SYNOPSIS
           say [-v voice] [-o out.aiff | -n name:port ] [-f file | string ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool uses the Speech Synthesis manager to convert input text to
       audible speech and either play it through the sound output device
       chosen in System Preferences or save it to an AIFF file.

OPTIONS
       string
           Specify the text to speak on the command line. This can consist of
           multiple arguments, which are considered to be separated by spaces.

       -f file
           Specify a file to be spoken. If file is - or neither this parameter
           nor a message is specified, read from standard input.

       -v voice
           Specify the voice to be used. Default is the voice selected in
           System Preferences.

       -o out.aiff
           Specify an AIFF file to be written.

       -n name
       -n name:port
       -n :port
       -n :
           Specify a service name (default "AUNetSend") and/or IP port to be
           used for redirecting the speech output through AUNetSend.

       If the input is a TTY, text is spoken line by line, and the output
       file, if specified, will only contain audio for the last line of the
       input.  Otherwise, text is spoken all at once.

ERRORS
       say returns 0 if the text was spoken successfully, otherwise non-zero.
       Diagnostic messages will be printed to standard error.
