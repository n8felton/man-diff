OSACOMPILE(1)             BSD General Commands Manual            OSACOMPILE(1)

NAME
     osacompile -- compile AppleScripts and other OSA language scripts

SYNOPSIS
     osacompile [-l language] [-e command] [-o name] [-d] [-r type:id]
                [-t type] [-c creator] [-x] [-s] [-u] [-a arch] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     osacompile compiles the given files, or standard input if none are
     listed, into a single output script.  Files may be plain text or other
     compiled scripts.  The options are as follows:

     -l language
           Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain
           text files are compiled as AppleScript.

     -e command
           Enter one line of a script.  Script commands given via -e are
           prepended to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e commands may
           be given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use
           characters that are special to many shell programs (e.g., Apple-
           Script uses single and double quote marks, ``('', ``)'', and
           ``*''), the command will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to
           get it past the shell intact.

     -o name
           Place the output in the file name.  If -o is not specified, the
           resulting script is placed in the file ``a.scpt''.

     -d    Place the resulting script in the data fork of the output file.

     -r type:id
           Place the resulting script in the resource fork of the output file,
           in the specified resource.

     -t type
           Set the output file type to type.  Type is a four-character code.
           If this option is omitted and the output file does not exist, the
           type is set to ``osas'', that is, a compiled script.

     -c creator
           Set the output file creator to creator.  Creator is a four-charac-
           ter code.  If this option is omitted and the output file does not
           exist, the creator is set to ``ToyS'', that is, Script Editor.

     -x    Save the resulting script as execute only.

     -s    Stay-open applet.  This option is only valid when a new bundled
           applet or droplet is being created.

     -u    Use startup screen.  This option is only valid when a new bundled
           applet or droplet is being created.

     -a arch
           Create the applet or droplet for the specified target architecture
           arch.  The allowable values are ``i386'' and ``ppc''.  By default,
           bundled applets and droplets are created as universal binaries.
           This option is only valid when a new bundled applet or droplet is
           being created.

     If no options are specified, osacompile produces a classic Mac OS format
     script file, that is, type ``osas'' (compiled script), creator ``ToyS''
     (Script Editor), with the script data in the scpt:128 resource and noth-
     ing in the data fork.  This format is compatible with all Mac OS and Mac
     OS X systems.

     If the -o option is specified and the file does not already exist,
     osacompile uses the filename extension to determine what type of file to
     create.  If the filename ends with ``.app'', a bundled applet or droplet
     will be created.  If the filename ends with ``.scptd'', a bundled com-
     piled script will be created.  Otherwise, the resulting script will be
     placed in the resource fork and/or data fork of the output file depending
     upon what other options are specified.

     The -d and -r options are not exclusive.  If exactly one is specified,
     the script is written only to that fork.  If both are specified, the
     script is written to both forks.
