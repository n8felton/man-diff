       xfsinfo - X font server information utility

SYNOPSIS
       xfsinfo [-server servername]

DESCRIPTION
       Xfsinfo is a utility for displaying information about an X font server.
       It is used to examine the capabilities of a server, the predefined val-
       ues  for  various  parameters used in communicating between clients and
       the server, and the font catalogues  and  alternate  servers  that  are
       available.

       -server host:port
              This option specifies the X font server to contact.
