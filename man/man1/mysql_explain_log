MYSQL_EXPLAIN_LOG(1)         MySQL Database System        MYSQL_EXPLAIN_LOG(1)



NAME
       mysql_explain_log - use EXPLAIN on statements in query log

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_explain_log [options] < log_file

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_explain_log reads its standard input for query log contents. It
       uses EXPLAIN to analyze SELECT statements found in the input.  UPDATE
       statements are rewritten to SELECT statements and also analyzed with
       EXPLAIN.  mysql_explain_log then displays a summary of its results.

       The results may assist you in determining which queries result in table
       scans and where it would be beneficial to add indexes to your tables.

       Invoke mysql_explain_log like this, where log_file contains all or part
       of a MySQL query log:

          shell> mysql_explain_log [options] < log_file

       mysql_explain_log understands the following options:

       o  --help, -?

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --date=YYMMDD, -d YYMMDD

          Select entries from the log only for the given date.

       o  --host=host_name, -h host_name

          Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o  --password=password, -p password

          The password to use when connecting to the server.

          Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
          insecure. See Section 5.5.6.2, "End-User Guidelines for Password
          Security".

       o  --printerror=1, -e 1

          Enable error output.

       o  --socket=path, -S path

          For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
          Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
