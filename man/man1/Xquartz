NAME
       Xquartz - X window system server for Quartz operating system

SYNOPSIS
       Xquartz [ options ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Xquartz is the X window server for Mac OS X provided by Apple.  Xquartz
       runs in parallel with Aqua in rootless mode. In rootless  mode,  the  X
       window  system and Mac OS X share your display.  The root window of the
       X11 display is the size of the screen and contains all the  other  win-
       dows. The X11 root window is not displayed in rootless mode as Mac OS X
       handles the desktop background.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the normal server options described  in  the  Xserver(1)
       manual page, Xquartz accepts the following command line switches:

       -fakebuttons
               Emulates  a 3 button mouse using modifier keys. By default, the
               Command modifier is used to emulate button 2 and Option is used
               for button 3. Thus, clicking the first mouse button while hold-
               ing down Command will act like clicking button 2. Holding  down
               Option will simulate button 3.

       -nofakebuttons
               Do not emulate a 3 button mouse. This is the default.

       -fakemouse2 modifiers
               Change  the modifier keys used to emulate the second mouse but-
               ton. By default, Command is used to emulate the second  button.
               Any  combination  of  the following modifier names may be used:
               Shift, Option, Control, Command, Fn. For  example,  -fakemouse2
               "Option,Shift"  will  set holding Option, Shift and clicking on
               button one as equivalent to clicking the second mouse button.

       -fakemouse3 modifiers
               Change the modifier keys used to emulate the third  mouse  but-
               ton.  By  default,  Option is used to emulate the third button.
               Any combination of the following modifier names  may  be  used:
               Shift,  Option,  Control, Command, Fn. For example, -fakemouse3
               "Control,Shift" will set holding Control, Shift and clicking on
               button one as equivalent to clicking the third mouse button.

       -swapAltMeta
               Swaps the meaning of the Alt and Meta modifier keys.

       -keymap file
               On  startup  Xquartz  translates  a Darwin keymapping into an X
               keymap.   The  default  is  to  read   this   keymapping   from
               USA.keymapping.  With  this  option the keymapping will be read
               from file instead. If the file's path is not specified, it will
               be  searched for in Library/Keyboards/ underneath the following
               directories (in order): ~, /, /Network, /System.

       -nokeymap
               On startup Xquartz translates a Darwin  keymapping  into  an  X
               keymap.   With  this  option Xquartz queries the kernel for the
               current keymapping instead of reading it from a file. This will
               often fail on newer kernels.

       -depth depth
               Specifies the color bit depth to use. Currently only 15, and 24
               color bits per pixel are supported. If not specified,  defaults
               to the depth of the main display.

CUSTOMIZATION
       Xquartz  can  also  be  customized  using  the defaults(1) command. The
       available options are:

       defaults write org.x.X11 enable_fake_buttons -boolean true
               Equivalent to the -fakebuttons command line option.

       defaults write org.x.X11 fake_button2 modifiers
               Equivalent to the -fakemouse2 option.

       defaults write org.x.X11 fake_button3 modifiers
               Equivalent to the -fakemouse3 option.

       defaults write org.x.X11 swap_alt_meta -boolean true
               Equivalent to the -swapAltMeta option.

       defaults write org.x.X11 keymap_file filename
               Equivalent to the -keymap option.

       defaults write org.x.X11 no_quit_alert -boolean true
               Disables the alert dialog displayed  when  attempting  to  quit
               X11.

       defaults write org.x.X11 no_auth -boolean true
               Stops  the  X  server requiring that clients authenticate them-
               selves when connecting. See Xsecurity(7).

       defaults write org.x.X11 nolisten_tcp -boolean true
               Prevents the X server accepting remote connections.

       defaults write org.x.X11 xinit_kills_server -boolean false
               Stops the X server exiting when the xinitrc script  terminates.

       defaults write org.x.X11 fullscreen_hotkeys -boolean false
               Allows  system  hotkeys  to  be handled while in X11 fullscreen
               mode.

       defaults write org.x.X11 enable_system_beep -boolean false
               Don't use the standard system beep effect for X11 alerts.

       defaults write org.x.X11 enable_key_equivalents -boolean false
               Disable  menu  keyboard  equivalents  while  X11  windows   are
               focused.

       defaults write org.x.X11 depth depth
               Equivalent to the -depth option.

AUTHORS
       XFree86  was originally ported to Mac OS X Server by John Carmack. Dave

       1.0.   Torrey  T.  Lyons  improved  and  integrated  this code into the
       XFree86 Project's mainline for the 4.0.2 release.
