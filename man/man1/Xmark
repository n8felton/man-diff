NAME
       Xmark - summarize x11perf results

SYNTAX
       Xmark datafile

DESCRIPTION
       Xmark  is a shell script that reads the indicated datafile and compiles
       a benchmark which it writes to standard output.  It writes  three  num-
       bers:

              A weighted performance number for the x11perf results.

              A  weighted  performance  number  for a standard SparcStation 1,
              with SunOS 4.1.2, X11R5 Xsun, and a CG3 dumb Color Frame Buffer.

              The Xmark, which is the ratio of the two numbers above.

       The  datafile must be an ordinary file, produced by x11perf in the fol-
       lowing way:

       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy GXxor -all > datafile

       It is possible to run the GXcopy and GXxor tests separately, as long as
       they are concatenated to the same output file:

       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy -all > datafile
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXxor -all >> datafile

       or

       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXxor -all > datafile
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy -all >> datafile


FILES
       temp.$$
              Temporary  file  created in the current directory, deleted after
              use.

       WARNING: datafile contains nnn, not 441 or 447 'trep' results;
              The file named on the command line does not seem to  be  a  file
              generated by x11perf in the expected way.
