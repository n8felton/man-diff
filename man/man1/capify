CAP(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAP(1)

NAME
     cap -- Ruby on Rails web applications deployment utility

SYNOPSIS
     cap [options] args
     capify [options] args

DESCRIPTION
     Capistrano is a utility for deploying web applications would be akin to
     saying that computers are machines that let you type school papers. It's
     a gross understatement.  Capistrano is actually capable of doing far, far
     more than just deploying web apps. However, because deployment of web
     apps is what Capistrano was originally created for, this manual will
     focus on that, and then spend a little time at the end showing some of
     the other possibilities.

     For more information about the cap cap and cap capify commands you can
     use their --h flag. There is also online documentation available at
     "http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/97".

     March 2006 in response to a trademark conflict.
