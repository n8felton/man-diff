XSUBPP(1)              Perl Programmers Reference Guide              XSUBPP(1)



NAME
       xsubpp - compiler to convert Perl XS code into C code

SYNOPSIS
       xsubpp [-v] [-C++] [-csuffix csuffix] [-except] [-s pattern] [-proto-
       types] [-noversioncheck] [-nolinenumbers] [-nooptimize] [-typemap
       typemap] ... file.xs

DESCRIPTION
       This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtU-
       tils::MakeMaker.

       xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the constructs
       necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates the
       glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses
       typemaps to determine how to map C function parameters and variables to
       Perl values.

       The compiler will search for typemap files called typemap.  It will use
       the following search path to find default typemaps, with the rightmost
       typemap taking precedence.

               ../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap

OPTIONS
       Note that the "XSOPT" MakeMaker option may be used to add these options
       to any makefiles generated by MakeMaker.

       -C++ Adds ``extern "C"'' to the C code.

       -csuffix csuffix
            Set the suffix used for the generated C or C++ code.  Defaults to
            '.c' (even with -C++), but some platforms might want to have e.g.
            '.cpp'.  Don't forget the '.' from the front.

       -hiertype
            Retains '::' in type names so that C++ hierachical types can be
            mapped.

       -except
            Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.

       -typemap typemap
            Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence over
            the default typemaps.  This option may be used multiple times,
            with the last typemap having the highest precedence.

       -v   Prints the xsubpp version number to standard output, then exits.

       -prototypes
            By default xsubpp will not automatically generate prototype code
            for all xsubs. This flag will enable prototypes.

       -noversioncheck
            Disables the run time test that determines if the object file
            (derived from the ".xs" file) and the ".pm" files have the same
            version number.

       -nolinenumbers
            Prevents the inclusion of `#line' directives in the output.

       -nooptimize
            Disables certain optimizations.  The only optimization that is
            currently affected is the use of targets by the output C code (see
            perlguts).  This may significantly slow down the generated code,
            but this is the way xsubpp of 5.005 and earlier operated.

       -noinout
            Disable recognition of "IN", "OUT_LIST" and "INOUT_LIST" declara-
            tions.

       -noargtypes
            Disable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function signa-
            ture.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.
