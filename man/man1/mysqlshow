MYSQLSHOW(1)                 MySQL Database System                MYSQLSHOW(1)



NAME
       mysqlshow - display database, table, and column information

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly see which databases exist,
       their tables, or a table's columns or indexes.

       mysqlshow provides a command-line interface to several SQL SHOW
       statements. See Section 12.4.5, "SHOW Syntax". The same information can
       be obtained by using those statements directly. For example, you can
       issue them from the mysql client program.

       Invoke mysqlshow like this:

           shell> mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

       o   If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.

       o   If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are
           shown.

       o   If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the
           table are shown.

       The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or
       columns for which you have some privileges.

       If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters ("*",
       "?", "%", or "_"), only those names that are matched by the wildcard
       are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be
       escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list
       of the proper tables or columns.  "*" and "?"  characters are converted
       into SQL "%" and "_" wildcard characters. This might cause some
       confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a "_" in
       the name, because in this case, mysqlshow shows you only the table
       names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
       "%" last on the command line as a separate argument.

       mysqlshow supports the following options, which can be specified on the
       command line or in the [mysqlshow] and [client] option file groups.
       mysqlshow also supports the options for processing option files
       described at Section 4.2.3.3.1, "Command-Line Options that Affect
       Option-File Handling".

       o   --help, -?

           Display a help message and exit.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 9.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --compress, -C

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       o   --count

           Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for non-MyISAM
           tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.6.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           'd:t:o,file_name'. The default is 'd:t:o'.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 9.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --keys, -k

           Show table indexes.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the password value following the
           --password or -p option on the command line, mysqlshow prompts for
           one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. See Section 5.3.2.2, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line. You can use an option file to avoid giving the
           password on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
           allowable values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
           Server".

       o   --show-table-type, -t

           Show a column indicating the table type, as in SHOW FULL TABLES.
           The type is BASE TABLE or VIEW. This option was added in MySQL
           5.0.4.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o   --ssl*

           Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
           server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
           certificates. See Section 5.5.6.3, "SSL Command Options".

       o   --status, -i

           Display extra information about each table.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
           This option can be used multiple times to increase the amount of
           information.

       o   --version, -V

           Display version information and exit.
