MYSQLSHOW(1)                 MySQL Database System                MYSQLSHOW(1)



NAME
       mysqlshow - display database, table, and column information

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly see which databases exist,
       their tables, or a table's columns or indexes.

       mysqlshow provides a command-line interface to several SQL SHOW
       statements. See Section 5.5, "SHOW Syntax". The same information can be
       obtained by using those statements directly. For example, you can issue
       them from the mysql client program.

       Invoke mysqlshow like this:

          shell> mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

       o  If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.

       o  If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are shown.

       o  If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the
          table are shown.


       The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or
       columns for which you have some privileges.

       If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters ("*",
       "?", "%", or "_"), only those names that are matched by the wildcard
       are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be
       escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list
       of the proper tables or columns.  "*" and "?"  characters are converted
       into SQL "%" and "_" wildcard characters. This might cause some
       confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a "_" in
       the name, because in this case, mysqlshow shows you only the table
       names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
       "%" last on the command line as a separate argument.

       mysqlshow supports the following options:

       o  --help, -?

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --character-sets-dir=path

          The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 2,
          "The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting".

       o  --compress, -C

          Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
          both support compression.

       o  --count

          Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for non-MyISAM
          tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.6.

       o  --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

          Write a debugging log. The debug_options string often is
          'd:t:o,file_name'.

       o  --default-character-set=charset_name

          Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 2, "The
          Character Set Used for Data and Sorting".

       o  --host=host_name, -h host_name

          Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o  --keys, -k

          Show table indexes.

       o  --password[=password], -p[password]

          The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
          short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
          and the password. If you omit the password value following the
          --password or -p option on the command line, you are prompted for
          one.

          Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
          insecure. See Section 5.6, "Keeping Your Password Secure".

          Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
          insecure. See Section 5.6, "Keeping Your Password Secure".

       o  --pipe, -W

          On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
          applies only for connections to a local server, and only if the
          server supports named-pipe connections.

       o  --port=port_num, -P port_num

          The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o  --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

          The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
          useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
          protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
          allowable values, see Section 2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL Server".

       o  --show-table-type, -t

          Show a column indicating the table type, as in SHOW FULL TABLES. The
          type is BASE TABLE or VIEW. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.4.

       o  --socket=path, -S path

          For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
          Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o  --ssl*

          Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
          server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates.
          See Section 5.7.3, "SSL Command Options".

       o  --status, -i

          Display extra information about each table.

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server.

       o  --verbose, -v

          Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
          This option can be used multiple times to increase the amount of
          information.

       o  --version, -V

          Display version information and exit.
