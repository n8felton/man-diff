       be browsed and searched by anyone. If you log in to the system, you can
       enter new reports. If you have no Web access, you can generate a bug
       report by using the mysqlbug script.

       mysqlbug helps you generate a report by determining much of the
       following information automatically, but if something important is
       missing, please include it with your message.  mysqlbug can be found in
       the scripts directory (source distribution) and in the bin directory
       under your MySQL installation directory (binary distribution).

       Invoke mysqlbug without arguments:

          shell> mysqlbug

       The script will place you in an editor with a copy of the report to be
       sent. Edit the lines near the beginning that indicate the nature of the
       problem. Then write the file to save your changes, quit the editor, and
       mysqlbug will send the report by email. perform.
