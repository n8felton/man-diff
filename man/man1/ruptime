NAME
     ruptime -- show host status of local machines

SYNOPSIS
     ruptime [-alrtu]

DESCRIPTION
     Ruptime gives a status line like uptime for each machine on the local
     network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each host on the net-
     work once a minute.

     Machines for which no status report has been received for 11 minutes are
     shown as being down.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the -a flag is
             given.

     -l      Sort by load average.

     -r      Reverses the sort order.

     -t      Sort by uptime.

     -u      Sort by number of users.

     The default listing is sorted by host name.
