MYSQL_FIX_PRIVILE(1)         MySQL Database System        MYSQL_FIX_PRIVILE(1)



NAME
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables - upgrade MySQL system tables

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables --password=root_password

DESCRIPTION
       Some releases of MySQL introduce changes to the structure of the system
       tables in the mysql database to add new privileges or support new
       features. When you update to a new version of MySQL, you should update
       your system tables as well to make sure that their structure is up to
       date. Otherwise, there might be capabilities that you cannot take
       advantage of.

       mysql_fix_privilege_tables is an older script that previously was used
       to uprade the system tables in the mysql database after a MySQL
       upgrade.

           Note
           As of MySQL 5.0.19, mysql_fix_privilege_tables is superseded by
           mysql_upgrade, which should be used instead. See mysql_upgrade(1).

       Before running mysql_fix_privilege_tables, make a backup of your mysql
       database.

       On Unix or Unix-like systems, update the system tables by running the
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables script:

           shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables

       You must run this script while the server is running. It attempts to
       connect to the server running on the local host as root. If your root
       account requires a password, indicate the password on the command line
       like this:

           shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables --password=root_password

       The mysql_fix_privilege_tables script performs any actions necessary to
       convert your system tables to the current format. You might see some
       Duplicate column name warnings as it runs; you can ignore them.

       After running the script, stop the server and restart it so that any
       changes made to the system tables take effect.

       On Windows systems, MySQL distributions include a
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql SQL script that you can run using the
       mysql client. For example, if your MySQL installation is located at
       C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0, the commands look like this:

           C:\> cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0"
           C:\> bin\mysql -u root -p mysql
           mysql> SOURCE share/mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql


           Note
           Prior to version 5.0.38, this script is found in the scripts
           directory.

       The mysql command will prompt you for the root password; enter it when
       prompted.

       If your installation is located in some other directory, adjust the
       path names appropriately.

       As with the Unix procedure, you might see some Duplicate column name
       warnings as mysql processes the statements in the
       mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql script; you can ignore them.

       After running the script, stop the server and restart it.
