LEAVE(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 LEAVE(1)

NAME
     leave -- remind you when you have to leave

SYNOPSIS
     leave [[+]hhmm]

DESCRIPTION
     leave waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you have to
     leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time,
     at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you log off, leave exits
     just before it would have printed the next message.

     Options:

     hhmm  The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in hours (on
           a 12 or 24 hour clock), and mm are minutes.  All times are con-
           verted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.

     +     If the time is preceded by `+', the alarm will go off in hours and
           minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, leave prompts with "When do you have to leave?".
     A reply of newline causes leave to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed
     to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a .login or
     .profile.

     Leave ignores interrupts, quits, and terminates.  To get rid of it you
     should either log off or use `kill -s KILL' giving its process id.
