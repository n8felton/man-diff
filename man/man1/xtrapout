DESCRIPTION
       These commands are SAMPLE CLIENTS provided  with  the  XTrap  X  Server
       Extension  Sources,  Version 3.3.  XTrap is an X Server extension which
       facilitates the capturing of  server  protocol  and  synthesizing  core
       input  events.  Information on how to obtain these sources can be found
       in the SOURCES section below.

       The xtrapreset command is the simplest XTrap client in that  it  merely
       performs  an XQueryExtension() against XTrap.  The name "reset" is his-
       torical.  The display argument is parsed by the X Toolkit and specifies
       the display where XTrap is to be loaded; see X(1).

       xtrapinfo  displays general configuration information as a result of an
       GetAvailable XTrap request to  the  specified  server.   It  is  simply
       designed  to test the request/response mechanism of the XTrap extension
       and client library as well as  display  the  configuration  information
       that it finds.

       xtrapstats  tests  the event and request vectoring of the server exten-
       sion by configuring XTrap to collect usage statistics on all core input
       events  and  requests.   It  has a primitive command-line interface for
       showing the counters, zeroing out the counters, and quitting  the  pro-
       gram.

       xtrapout  tests  the  output  transport from the XTrap extension to the
       XTrap client library.  As an aside, since xtrapout has  the  capability
       of  "recording"  events and requests it receives, xtrapout is ideal for
       providing input to test xtrapin.  Since events are the only concern for
       the  input transport, the -e flag can be specified to indicate that all
       input events (and only events) should be recorded by xtrapout.   script
       is  specified  primarily  for non-U*IX machines which don't support I/O
       re-direction easily.  The -v flag is used to  force  recording  of  all
       requests and input events.

       xtrapin  is used to test the input transport to the XTrap server exten-
       sion.  As stated earlier, it's input can be provided by xtrapout  using
       the -e qualifier.  While it's primary function is for testing XTrap and
       serving as an example for XTrap functionality, it can  reasonably  used
       as a primitive "playback" client for X sessions.

       xtrapchar parses ANSI character sequences including application program
       sequences to synthesize input events to  X  Window  servers  using  the
       XTrap  server  extension.   The intent of this program is to serve as a
       sample implementation for interfacing character-based alternative input
       sources  into  X  servers  (e.g.   voice recognition systems).  Another
       application might be "remote keyboards".  The -v flag causes  the  pro-
       gram  to  display XTrap configuration information and echo's characters
       processed to stdout.  If present, this must be the first argument.

       Note: xtrapchar has only been used with Digital Workstations using  the
       LK201  compatible keyboard.  Though reasonable effort was done to main-
       tain portability,  no claims are made as to the current level of porta-
       bility to non-DEC servers for this program.

       The  xtrapproto command is a regression test designed to test the basic
       XTrap protocol between a client and server.  If a given  implementation
       is  suspect, the results of this test should be sent to an XTrap imple-
       mentor and/or developer.

OPTIONS
       -d[isplay] display
           Specifies the server to record from or playback to; see


       -e  Record only (and all) events.  Should be used when  creating  input
           for


       -f script
           The pathname of the script to be recorded / played back.


       -v  Verbose mode.


DIAGNOSTICS
       X Toolkit Error: Can't load DEC-XTRAP extension

       The  XTrap  X server extension has not been linked into the specified X
       server.

IMPORTANT NOTE
       Digital participated in the X Consortium's xtest  working  group  which
       chose  to  evolve  XTrap  functionality into a new extension for X11/R6
       known as the RECORD extension (XTrap input synthesis  functionality  is
       currently  covered  by  the XTEST extension).  It is strongly suggested
       that users of XTrap technology begin developing against RECORD/XTEST as
       it  is  the intention of the X Consortium to drive these two extensions
       in the standards process for providing the protocol capturing/synthesis
       functionality.   Some  members  of the xtest working group are actively
       researching migration issues between XTrap and RECORD.  If  you'd  like
       to contribute, please participate!  Contact your local X Consortium Rep
       for details on how to be added to the xtest mailing list.
