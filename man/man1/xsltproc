INTRODUCTION
        xsltproc is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets  to  XML
       documents.  It  is part of libxslt, the XSLT C library for GNOME. While
       it was developed as part of the GNOME project, it can operate  indepen-
       dently of the GNOME desktop.


        xsltproc  is  invoked  from  the  command  line  with  the name of the
       stylesheet to be used followed by the name of  the  file  or  files  to
       which  the  stylesheet is to be applied. It will use the standard input
       if a filename provided is - .


       If a stylesheet is included in an XML document with a  Stylesheet  Pro-
       cessing  Instruction,  no stylesheet need be named at the command line.
       xsltproc will automatically detect the included stylesheet and use  it.


       By  default, output is to stdout. You can specify a file for output us-
       ing the -o option.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -V or --version
              Show the version of libxml and libxslt used.


       -v or --verbose
              Output each step taken by xsltproc in processing the  stylesheet
              and the document.


       -o or --output file
              Direct output to the file named file. For multiple outputs, also
              known as "chunking", -o directory/ directs the output files to a
              specified directory. The directory must already exist.


       --timing
              Display  the  time  used for parsing the stylesheet, parsing the
              document and applying the stylesheet and saving the result. Dis-
              played in milliseconds.


       --repeat
              Run the transformation 20 times. Used for timing tests.


       --debug
              Output  an  XML  tree  of the transformed document for debugging
              purposes.


       --novalid
              Skip loading the document's DTD.


       --noout
              Do not output the result.


       --maxdepth value
              Adjust the maximum depth of the template  stack  before  libxslt
              concludes it is in an infinite loop. The default is 500.


       --html The input document is an HTML file.


       --param name value
              Pass a parameter of name name and value value to the stylesheet.
              You may pass multiple name/value pairs up to a maximum of 32. If
              the  value being passed is a string rather than a node identifi-
              er, use --stringparam instead.


       --stringparam name value
              Pass a paramenter of name name and value value where value is  a
              string  rather than a node identifier. (Note: The string must be
              utf-8.)


       --nonet
              Do not use the Internet to fetch DTD's, entities or documents.


       --path paths
              Use the list (separated by space or column) of filesystem  paths
              specified by paths to load DTDs, entities or documents.


       --load-trace
              Display  to  stderr all the documents loaded during the process-
              ing.


       --catalogs
              Use the SGML catalog specified in SGML_CATALOG_FILES to  resolve
              the  location  of  external entities. By default, xsltproc looks
              for the catalog specified in XML_CATALOG_FILES. If that  is  not
              specified, it uses /etc/xml/catalog.


       --xinclude
              Process  the  input  document  using the Xinclude specification.
              More details on this can be found in the Xinclude specification:
              http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/: http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/


       --profile or --norman
              Output  profiling information detailing the amount of time spent
              in each part of the stylesheet. This  is  useful  in  optimizing
              stylesheet performance.


       --dumpextensions
              Dumps the list of all registered extensions on stdout.


       --nowrite
              Refuses to write to any file or resource.


       --nomkdir
              Refuses to create directories.


       --writesubtree path
              Allow file write only within the path subtree.


RETURN VALUES
       xsltproc's return codes provide information that can be used when call-
       ing it from scripts.

       1: no argument


       2: too many parameters


       3: unknown option

       5: error in the stylesheet


       6: error in one of the documents


       7: unsupported xsl:output method


       8: string parameter contains both quote and double-quotes


       9: internal processing error


       10: processing was stopped by a terminating message
