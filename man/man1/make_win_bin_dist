MAKE_WIN_BIN_DIST(1)         MySQL Database System        MAKE_WIN_BIN_DIST(1)



NAME
       make_win_bin_dist - package MySQL distribution as ZIP archive

SYNOPSIS
       make_win_bin_dist [options] package_basename [copy_def ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used on Windows after building a MySQL distribution from
       source to create executable programs. It packages the binaries and
       support files into a ZIP archive that can be unpacked at the location
       where you want to install MySQL.

       make_win_bin_dist is a shell script, so you must have Cygwin installed
       to use it.

       This program's use is subject to change. Currently, you invoke it as
       follows from the root directory of your source distribution:

          shell> make_win_bin_dist [options] package_basename [copy_def ...]

       The package_basename argument provides the basename for the resulting
       ZIP archive. This name will be the name of the directory that results
       from unpacking the archive.

       Because you might want to include files of directories from other
       builds, you can instruct this script do copy them in for you, via
       copy_def arguments, which of which is of the form
       relative_dest_name=source_name.

       Example:

          bin/mysqld-max.exe=../my-max-build/sql/release/mysqld.exe

       If you specify a directory, the entire directory will be copied.

       make_win_bin_dist supports the following options:

       o  --debug

          Pack the debug binaries and produce an error if they were not built.

       o  --embedded

          Pack the embedded server and produce an error if it was not built.
          The default is to pack it if it was built.

       o  --exe-suffix=suffix

          Add a suffix to the basename of the mysql binary. For example, a
          suffix of -abc produces a binary named mysqld-abc.exe.

       o  --no-debug

          Don't pack the debug binaries even if they were built.

       o  --no-embedded

          Don't pack the embedded server even if it was built.

       o  --only-debug

          Use this option when the target for this build was Debug, and you
          just want to replace the normal binaries with debug versions (that
          is, do not use separate debug directories).
