MYSQLHOTCOPY(1)              MySQL Database System             MYSQLHOTCOPY(1)



NAME
       mysqlhotcopy - a database backup program

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlhotcopy arguments

DESCRIPTION
       mysqlhotcopy is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Tim Bunce. It uses LOCK TABLES, FLUSH TABLES, and cp or
       scp to make a database backup quickly. It is the fastest way to make a
       backup of the database or single tables, but it can be run only on the
       same machine where the database directories are located.  mysqlhotcopy
       works only for backing up MyISAM and ARCHIVE tables. It runs on Unix
       and NetWare.

          shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name [/path/to/new_directory]

          shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name_1 ... db_name_n /path/to/new_directory

       Back up tables in the given database that match a regular expression:

          shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./regex/

       The regular expression for the table name can be negated by prefixing
       it with a tilde ("~"):

          shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./~regex/

       mysqlhotcopy supports the following options:

       o  --help, -?

          Display a help message and exit.

       o  --addtodest

          Do not rename target directory (if it exists); merely add files to
          it.

       o  --allowold

          Do not abort if a target exists; rename it by adding an _old suffix.

       o  --checkpoint=db_name.tbl_name

          Insert checkpoint entries into the specified database db_name and
          table tbl_name.

       o  --chroot=path

          Base directory of the chroot jail in which mysqld operates. The path
          value should match that of the --chroot option given to mysqld.

       o  --debug

          Enable debug output.

       o  --dryrun, -n

          Report actions without performing them.

       o  --flushlog

          Flush logs after all tables are locked.

       o  --host=host_name, -h host_name

          The hostname of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP connection
          to the local server. By default, the connection is made to localhost
          using a Unix socket file.

       o  --keepold

          Do not delete previous (renamed) target when done.

       o  --method=command

          The method for copying files (cp or scp).

       o  --noindices

          Do not include full index files in the backup. This makes the backup
          smaller and faster. The indexes for reloaded tables can be
          reconstructed later with myisamchk -rq.

       o  --password=password, -ppassword

          The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the
          password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other
          MySQL programs. You can use an option file to avoid giving the
          password on the command line.

          Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
          insecure. See Section 5.6, "Keeping Your Password Secure".

       o  --port=port_num, -P port_num

          The TCP/IP port number to use when connecting to the local server.

       o  --quiet, -q

          Be silent except for errors.

       o  --record_log_pos=db_name.tbl_name

          Record master and slave status in the specified database db_name and
          table tbl_name.

       o  --regexp=expr

          Copy all databases with names that match the given regular
          expression.

       o  --resetmaster

          Reset the binary log after locking all the tables.

       o  --resetslave

          Reset the master.info file after locking all the tables.

       o  --socket=path, -S path

          The Unix socket file to use for the connection.

       o  --suffix=str

          The suffix for names of copied databases.

       o  --tmpdir=path

          The temporary directory. The default is /tmp.

       o  --user=user_name, -u user_name

          The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server.


       mysqlhotcopy reads the [client] and [mysqlhotcopy] option groups from
       option files.

       To execute mysqlhotcopy, you must have access to the files for the
       tables that you are backing up, the SELECT privilege for those tables,
       the RELOAD privilege (to be able to execute FLUSH TABLES), and the LOCK
       TABLES privilege (to be able to lock the tables).

       Use perldoc for additional mysqlhotcopy documentation, including
       information about the structure of the tables needed for the
       --checkpoint and --record_log_pos options:

          shell> perldoc mysqlhotcopy
