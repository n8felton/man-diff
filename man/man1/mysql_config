MYSQL_CONFIG(1)              MySQL Database System             MYSQL_CONFIG(1)



NAME
       mysql_config - get compile options for compiling clients

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_config options

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_config provides you with useful information for compiling your
       MySQL client and connecting it to MySQL.

       mysql_config supports the following options.

       o   --cflags

           Compiler flags to find include files and critical compiler flags
           and defines used when compiling the libmysqlclient library. The
           options returned are tied to the specific compiler that was used
           when the library was created and might clash with the settings for
           your own compiler. Use --include for more portable options that
           contain only include paths.

       o   --include

           Compiler options to find MySQL include files.

       o   --libmysqld-libs, --embedded

           Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL embedded
           server.

       o   --libs

           Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL client
           library.

       o   --libs_r

           Libraries and options required to link with the thread-safe MySQL
           client library.

       o   --port

           The default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring MySQL.

       o   --socket

           The default Unix socket file, defined when configuring MySQL.

       o   --version

           Version number for the MySQL distribution.

       If you invoke mysql_config with no options, it displays a list of all
       options that it supports, and their values:

           shell> mysql_config
           Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
           Options:
             --cflags         [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
             --include        [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
             --libs           [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz
                               -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -L/usr/lib -lssl -lcrypto]
             --libs_r         [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
                               -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread]
             --socket         [/tmp/mysql.sock]
             --port           [3306]
             --version        [4.0.16]
             --libmysqld-libs [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqld -lpthread -lz
                               -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread -lrt]

       You can use mysql_config within a command line to include the value
       that it displays for a particular option. For example, to compile a
       MySQL client program, use mysql_config as follows:

           shell> CFG=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
           shell> sh -c "gcc -o progname `$CFG --include` progname.c `$CFG --libs`"

       When you use mysql_config this way, be sure to invoke it within
       backtick ("`") characters. That tells the shell to execute it and
       substitute its output into the surrounding command.
