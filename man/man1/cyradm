NAME
       cyradm - Cyrus administration shell, alter ego of Cyrus::IMAP::Shell

SYNOPSIS
         $ cyradm [--user user] [--[no]rc] [--systemrc file] [--userrc file] \
         > [--port n] [--auth mechanism] [--tlskey keyfile] [--notls] \
         > [--server] server

       but possibly

         $ perl -MCyrus::IMAP::Shell -e 'run("myscript")'

       or even (not recommended)

         use Cyrus::IMAP::Admin::Shell;

         run('myscriptname');

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements cyradm in Perl.  It is a shell around
       Cyrus::IMAP::Admin.  Commands are provided in both Tcl-compatible forms
       and GNU-style long option forms.

COMMANDS
       "authenticate" ["--minssf" N] ["--maxssf" N] ["--mechanisms" list]
       [user]
       "auth" ["--minssf" N] ["--maxssf" N] ["--mechanisms" list] [user]
       "login" ["--minssf" N] ["--maxssf" N] ["--mechanisms" list] [user]
           Authenticate to server.  You must already be connected to a server
           and Cyrus imapd will refuse to allow you to re-authenticate once
           you have authenticated once.

       "chdir" directory
       "cd" directory
           Change directory.  A "pwd" builtin is not provided, but the default
           command action will run "pwd" from a shell if invoked.

       "createmailbox" ["--partition" partition] mailbox
       "createmailbox" mailbox partition
       "create" ["--partition" partition] mailbox
       "create" mailbox partition
       "cm" ["--partition" partition] mailbox
       "cm" mailbox partition
           Create a mailbox on the default or a specified partition.  Both
           old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted (combining them will
           produce an error).

       "deleteaclmailbox" mailbox id [...]
       "deleteacl" mailbox id [...]
       "dam" mailbox id [...]
           Remove ACLs from the specified mailbox.

       "deletemailbox" mailbox
       "delete" mailbox
       "dm" mailbox
           Delete the specified mailbox.

           Administrators do not have implicit delete rights on mailboxes.
           Use the setaclmailbox command to grant the "x" permission to your
           principal if you need to delete a mailbox you do not own.

           Note that the online help admits to an optional host argument.
           This argument is not currently used, and will be rejected with an
           error if specified; it is reserved for IMSP.

       "disconnect"
       "disc"
           Disconnect from the current server.  The prompt will revert to
           "cyradm>".

       "exit" [number]
       "quit" [number]
           Exit cyradm, optionally with a specific exit status; the exit
           status of the last command will be used if one is not specified.

       help [command]
       ? [command]
           Show help for "command" or all commands.

       "info" [mailbox]
           Display the mailbox/server metadata.

       "listaclmailbox" mailbox
       "listacl" mailbox
       "lam" mailbox
           List ACLs on the specified mailbox.

       "listmailbox" ["--subscribed"] [pattern [reference]]
       "list" ["--subscribed"] [pattern [reference]]
       "lm" ["--subscribed"] [pattern [reference]]
           List all, or all subscribed, mailboxes matching the specified
           pattern.  The pattern may have embedded wildcards '*' or '%', which
           match anything or anything except the separator character,
           respectively.

           Mailboxes returned will be relative to the specified reference if
           one is specified.  This allows a mailbox list to be limited to a
           particular hierarchy.

           In some cases when the '%' wildcard is used to end a pattern, it
           may match an entry which is not a mailbox but which contains other
           mailboxes.  In this case, the entry will be parenthesized to
           indicate that it is a root for other mailboxes, as opposed to a
           mailbox itself.

       "listquota" root
       "lq" root
           List quotas on specified root.  If the specified mailbox path does
           not have a quota assigned, an error will be raised; see
           listquotaroot for a way to find the quota root for a mailbox.

       "listquotaroot" mailbox
       "lqm" mailbox
       "lqr" mailbox?
           show quota roots and quotas for mailbox

       "mboxconfig" mailbox attribute value
       "mboxcfg" mailbox attribute value
           Set mailbox metadata.  A value of "none" will remove the attribute.
           The currently supported attributes are:

           "comment"
               Sets a comment or description associated with the mailbox.

           "condstore"
               Enables the IMAP CONDSTORE extension (modification sequences)
               on the mailbox.

           "expire"
               Sets the number of days after which messages will be expired
               from the mailbox.

           "sieve"
               Indicates the name of the global sieve script that should be
               run when a message is delivered to the shared mailbox (not used
               for personal mailboxes).

           "squat"
               Indicates that the mailbox should have a squat index created
               for it.

           "news2mail"
               Sets an email address to which messages injected into the
               server via NNTP will be sent.

       "renamemailbox" ["--partition" partition] oldname newname
       "rename" ["--partition" partition] oldname newname
       "renm" ["--partition" partition] oldname newname
       "renamemailbox" oldname newname [partition]
       "rename" oldname newname [partition]
       "renm" oldname newname [partition]
           Rename the specified mailbox, optionally moving it to a different
           partition.  Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted;
           combining them will produce an error.

       server [--noauthenticate] [server]
       connect [--noauthenticate] [server]
       servername [--noauthenticate] [server]
           With no arguments, show the current server.  With an argument,
           connect to that server.  It will prompt for automatic login unless
           the "--noauthenticate" option is specified.  (This may change; in
           particular, either automatic authentication will be removed or all
           "authenticate" options will be added.)

           When connected to a server, cyradm's prompt changes from "cyradm>"
           to "servername>", where servername is the fully qualified domain
           name of the connected server.

       "setaclmailbox" mailbox id rights [id rights ...]
       "setacl" mailbox id rights [id rights ...]
       "sam" mailbox id rights [id rights ...]
           Set ACLs on a mailbox.  The ACL may be one of the special strings
           "none", "read" ("lrs"), "post" ("lrsp"), "append" ("lrsip"),
           "write" ("lrswipkxte"), "delete" ("lrxte"), or "all"
           ("lrswipkxte"), or any combinations of the ACL codes:

           l   Lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB, SUBSCRIBE mailbox)

           r   Read (SELECT/EXAMINE the mailbox, perform STATUS)

           s   Seen (set/clear \SEEN flag via STORE, also set \SEEN flag
               during
                   APPEND/COPY/FETCH BODY[...])

           w   Write flags other than \SEEN and \DELETED

           i   Insert (APPEND, COPY destination)

           p   Post (send mail to mailbox)

           k   Create mailbox (CREATE new sub-mailboxes, parent for new
               mailbox in RENAME)

           x   Delete mailbox (DELETE mailbox, old mailbox name in RENAME)

           t   Delete messages (set/clear \DELETED flag via STORE, also set
               \DELETED
                   flag during APPEND/COPY)

           e   Perform EXPUNGE and expunge as part of CLOSE

           a   Administer (SETACL/DELETEACL/GETACL/LISTRIGHTS)

       "setinfo" attribute value
           Set server metadata.  A value of "none" will remove the attribute.
           The currently supported attributes are:

           "motd"
               Sets a "message of the day".  The message gets displayed as an
               ALERT after authentication.

           "comment"
               Sets a comment or description associated with the server.

           "admin"
               Sets the administrator email address for the server.

           "shutdown"
               Sets a shutdown message.  The message gets displayed as an
               ALERT and all users are disconnected from the server
               (subsequent logins are disallowed).

           "expire"
               Sets the number of days after which messages will be expired
               from the server (unless overridden by a mailbox annotation).

           "squat"
               Indicates that all mailboxes should have a squat indexes
               created for them (unless overridden by a mailbox annotation).

       "setquota" root resource value [resource value ...]
       "sq" root resource value [resource value ...]
           Set a quota on the specified root, which may or may not be an
           actual mailbox.  The only resource understood by Cyrus is
           "STORAGE".  The value may be the special string "none" which will
           remove the quota.

       "version"
       "ver"
           Display the version info of the current server.

       "xfermailbox" ["--partition" partition] mailbox server
       "xfer" ["--partition" partition] mailbox server
       "xfermailbox" mailbox server [partition]
       "xfer" mailbox server [partition]
           Transfer (relocate) the specified mailbox to a different server.
           Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted; combining them
           will produce an error.

NOTES
       GNU-style long options must be given in their entirety; Tcl-style
       options may be abbreviated.

       Tcl-style options are provided as a compatibility feature.  They will
       probably go away in the future.

       Multiple commands can be given on a line, separated by ';' characters.

       All commands set an exit status, which at present is not useful.

       Unknown commands are passed to a subshell for execution.

       The Tcl version of cyradm is used for scripting as well as
       interactively.  While this is possible to a limited extent by use of
       the "run" method, scripting would normally be done with
       "Cyrus::IMAP::Admin", which is far more flexible than either
       interactive "cyradm" or the Tcl scripting mechanism for Cyrus.

       cyradm understands /bin/sh-style redirection:  any command can have its
       standard or error output redirected, with all sh-style redirections
       (except "<>") supported.  It does not currently understand pipes or
       backgrounding.

       If the "Term::Readline::Perl" or "Term::Readline::GNU" modules are
       available, cyradm will use it.

       An alias facility is implemented internally, but no access is currently
       provided to it.  This will change, if only to allow some of the
       predefined aliases to be removed if they conflict with useful shell
       commands.
