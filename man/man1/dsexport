NAME
     dsexport

SYNOPSIS
     dsexport filePath DSNodePath recordType [<options>] [<DSProxy>]

              The first three arguments are required and order dependent. All
              other arguments may or may not be required, depending on what
              operation the tool is performing.

DESCRIPTION
     dsexport is a tool for exporting records from Open Directory.

OPTIONS
     filePath              is a path to the file to be created and in which
                           the data should be exported to. If the file already
                           exists it will be overwritten.

     DSNodePath            is the path to the DS node where the records will
                           be read from.

     recordType            is the type of DS record to be exported from the
                           node. If the record type does not have a 'dsRec-
                           TypeStandard:' or a 'dsRecTypeNative:' prefix the
                           tool will search the node to see if the record type
                           is a supported standard attribute and if this is
                           the case it will export those records. If not the
                           record type is considered to be native. Standard
                           Record types are defined in DirServicesConst.h

     [-r <recordName>]     is a list of the DS recordNames we wish to export
                           from the Node. The names are to be separated by a
                           comma (","). If no record names are specified the
                           tool exports all the records on the specified node.
                           Example: '-r admin, root, user1'

     [-e <attributesToBeExcluded>]
                           is a list of attribute types that should not be
                           exported for every record. The attributes types are
                           to be separated by a comma (",").

                           The following record types are always excluded:
                           'dsAttrTypeStandard:AppleMetaNodeLocation, dsAttr-
                           TypeStandard:RecordType, dsAttrTypeNative:object-
                           Class'

     --N                   is the flag to tell the tool to export the native
                           attributes as well as the standard attributes. By
                           default the tool only exports standard attributes.

DSPROXY
     This is to be used in order to connect to a proxy machine. All three
     options are needed. If you do not specify the password as an argument the
     tool will prompt you for it.

     [-a <proxyAddress>]   is the address of the proxy machine the user wishes
                           to use.

     [-u <proxyUser>]      Specifies user name to use for the proxy connection

     [-p <proxyPassword>]  Specifies password to use for the proxy connection.
                           For proxy connections name/password are required.
                           If the this option is not specified and the user
                           has specified a proxy machine and username the tool
                           will prompt the user for the password.

NOTES
     When using an LDAP node please be aware that this tool can only export as
     many records as the LDAP server is willing to return. This means that if
     you have several thousand users you might want to raise the maximum num-
     ber of search results that the server returns. This can be done in Server
     Admin (my.server.com>OpenDirectory>Settings> Protocols tab). By default
     this is set to 11000 results.

EXAMPLES
     Export all userRecords from the local node to export.out:

           $ dsexport export.out /Local/Default dsRecTypeStandard:Users

     Export the group records for admin and staff from the LDAPv3 Node on a
     proxy machine 'proxy.machine.com':

           $ dsexport export.out /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 dsRecTypeStandard:Groups -r
           admin, staff -a proxy.machine.com -u diradmin -p pass
