FC-CACHE(1)                                                        FC-CACHE(1)



NAME
       fc-cache - build font information cache files

SYNOPSIS
       fc-cache  [  -fsvV?  ]  [  --force  ] [ --system-only ] [ --verbose ] [
       --version ] [ --help ] [ dirs ]


DESCRIPTION
       fc-cache scans the font directories  on  the  system  and  builds  font
       information  cache  files  for  applications using fontconfig for their
       font handling.

       If directory arguments are not given, fc-cache uses each  directory  in
       the  current  font  configuration.  Each  directory is scanned for font
       files readable by FreeType.  A cache is created which contains  proper-
       ties  of  each font and the associated filename.  This cache is used to
       speed up application startup when using the fontconfig library.

       Note that fc-cache must be executed once per architecture  to  generate
       font  information  customized  for  that architecture.  On a subsequent
       run, fc-cache will augment the cache information files with the  infor-
       mation for the new architecture.

OPTIONS
       This  program  follows  the  usual  GNU  command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two  dashes  (`-').   A  summary  of  options  is
       included below.

       -f --force
              Force  re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache files, over-
              riding the timestamp checking.

       -s --system-only
              Only scan system-wide directories, omitting the  places  located
              in the user's home directory.

       -v --verbose
              Display status information while busy.

       -? --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V --version
              Show version of the program and exit.

       dirs   A list of directories to scan for fonts.

FILES
       fonts.cache-2
              These files are generated by fc-cache and contain maps from file
              names to font  properties.  They  are  read  by  the  fontconfig
              library at application startup to locate appropriate fonts.
