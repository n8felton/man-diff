DOT_CLEAN(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             DOT_CLEAN(1)

NAME
     dot_clean -- Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.

SYNOPSIS
     dot_clean [-fmnsv] [-keep=[mostrecent|dotbar|native]] [dir ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a dir , dot_clean it recursively merges all
     ._* files with their corresponding native files according to the rules
     specified with the given arguments.

     If no operands are given, a usage message is output.  If more than one
     directory is given, directories are merged in the order in which they are
     specified on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     -f      Flat merge.  Do not recursively merge all directories in the
             given dir.  This is off by default.

     -h      Help. Prints verbose usage message.

     -m      Always delete dot underbar files.

     -n      Delete dot underbar file if there is no matching native file.

     -s      Follow symbolic links.  This will follow symbolic dot underbar
             files when they are found.

     -v      Print verbose output.

EXAMPLES
     The following is how to do an dot_clean merge on the mounted volume test,
     always using the dot underbar information.

           dot_clean --keep=dotbar /Volumes/test
