FTPD.CONF(5)                BSD File Formats Manual               FTPD.CONF(5)

NAME
     ftpd.conf -- tnftpd(8) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The ftpd.conf file specifies various configuration options for tnftpd(8)
     that apply once a user has authenticated their connection.

     ftpd.conf consists of a series of lines, each of which may contain a con-
     figuration directive, a comment, or a blank line.  Directives that appear
     later in the file override settings by previous directives.  This allows
     `wildcard' entries to define defaults, and then have class-specific over-
     rides.

     A directive line has the format:
           command class [arguments]

     A ``\'' is the escape character; it can be used to escape the meaning of
     the comment character, or if it is the last character on a line, extends
     a configuration directive across multiple lines.  A ``#'' is the comment
     character, and all characters from it to the end of line are ignored
     (unless it is escaped with the escape character).

     Each authenticated user is a member of a class, which is determined by
     ftpusers(5).  class is used to determine which ftpd.conf entries apply to
     the user.  The following special classes exist when parsing entries in
     ftpd.conf:
           all     Matches any class.
           none    Matches no class.

     Each class has a type, which may be one of:

           GUEST   Guests (as per the ``anonymous'' and ``ftp'' logins).  A
                   chroot(2) is performed after login.

           CHROOT  chroot(2)ed users (as per ftpchroot(5)).  A chroot(2) is
                   performed after login.

           REAL    Normal users.

     The tnftpd(8) STAT command will return the class settings for the current
     user as defined by ftpd.conf, unless the private directive is set for the
     class.

     Each configuration line may be one of:

     advertize class [host]
           Set the address to advertise in the response to the PASV and LPSV
           commands to the address for host (which may be either a host name
           or IP address).  This may be useful in some firewall configura-
           tions, although many ftp clients may not work if the address being
           advertised is different to the address that they've connected to.
           If class is ``none'' or host not is specified, disable this.

     checkportcmd class [off]
           Check the PORT command for validity.  The PORT command will fail if
           the IP address specified does not match the FTP command connection,
           or if the remote TCP port number is less than IPPORT_RESERVED.  It
           is strongly encouraged that this option be used, especially for
           sites concerned with potential security problems with FTP bounce
           attacks.  If class is ``none'' or off is specified, disable this
           feature, otherwise enable it.

     chroot class [pathformat]
           If pathformat is not specified or class is ``none'', use the
           default behavior (see below).  Otherwise, pathformat is parsed to
           create a directory to create as the root directory with chroot(2)
           into upon login.

           pathformat can contain the following escape strings:
                 Escape  Description
                 %c      Class name.
                 %d      Home directory of user.
                 %u      User name.
                 %%      A ``%'' character.

           The default root directory is:
                 CHROOT  The user's home directory.
                 GUEST   If -a anondir is specified, use anondir, otherwise
                         the home directory of the `ftp' user.
                 REAL    By default no chroot(2) is performed.

     classtype class type
           Set the class type of class to type (see above).

     conversion class suffix [type disable command]
           Define an automatic in-line file conversion.  If a file to retrieve
           ends in suffix, and a real file (sans suffix) exists, then the out-
           put of command is returned instead of the contents of the file.

                 suffix   The suffix to initiate the conversion.

                 type     A list of valid filetypes for the conversion.  Valid
                          types are: `f' (file), and `d' (directory).

                 disable  The name of file that will prevent conversion if it
                          exists.  A file name of ``.'' will prevent this dis-
                          abling action (i.e., the conversion is always per-
                          mitted.)

                 command  The command to run for the conversion.  The first
                          word should be the full path name of the command, as
                          execv(3) is used to execute the command.  All
                          instances of the word ``%s'' in command are replaced
                          with the requested file (sans suffix).

           Conversion directives specified later in the file override earlier
           conversions with the same suffix.

     denyquick class [off]
           Enforce ftpusers(5) rules after the USER command is received,
           rather than after the PASS command is received.  Whilst enabling
           this feature may allow information leakage about available accounts
           (for example, if you allow some users of a REAL or CHROOT class but
           not others), it is useful in preventing a denied user (such as
           `root') from entering their password across an insecure connection.
           This option is strongly recommended for servers which run an anony-
           mous-only service.  If class is ``none'' or off is specified, dis-
           able this feature, otherwise enable it.

     display class [file]
           If file is not specified or class is ``none'', disable this.  Oth-
           erwise, each time the user enters a new directory, check if file
           exists, and if so, display its contents to the user.  Escape
           sequences are supported; refer to Display file escape sequences in
           tnftpd(8) for more information.

     hidesymlinks class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, disable this feature.
           Otherwise, the LIST command lists symbolic links as the file or
           directory the link references (``ls -LlA'').  Servers which run an
           anonymous service may wish to enable this feature for GUEST users,
           so that symbolic links do not leak names in directories that are
           not searchable by GUEST users.

     homedir class [pathformat]
           If pathformat is not specified or class is ``none'', use the
           default behavior (see below).  Otherwise, pathformat is parsed to
           create a directory to change into upon login, and to use as the
           `home' directory of the user for tilde expansion in pathnames, etc.
           pathformat is parsed as per the chroot directive.

           The default home directory is the home directory of the user for
           REAL users, and / for GUEST and CHROOT users.

     limit class [count [file]]
           Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections for class to
           count, with `-1' meaning unlimited connections.  If the limit is
           exceeded and file is specified, display its contents to the user.
           If class is ``none'' or count is not specified, disable this.  If
           file is a relative path, it will be searched for in /etc (which can
           be overridden with -c confdir).

     maxfilesize class [size]
           Set the maximum size of an uploaded file to size, with `-1' meaning
           unlimited connections.  If class is ``none'' or size is not speci-
           fied, disable this.

     maxtimeout class [time]
           Set the maximum timeout period that a client may request, default-
           ing to two hours.  This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or the
           value for timeout.  If class is ``none'' or time is not specified,
           use the default.

     mmapsize class [size]
           Set the size of the sliding window to map a file using mmap(2).  If
           zero, tnftpd(8) will use read(2) instead.  The default is zero.  An
           optional suffix may be provided as per rateget.  This option
           affects only binary transfers.  If class is ``none'' or size is not
           specified, use the default.

     modify class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, disable the following
           commands: CHMOD, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNFR, and UMASK.  Otherwise,
           enable them.

     motd class [file]
           If file is not specified or class is ``none'', disable this.  Oth-
           erwise, use file as the message of the day file to display after
           login.  Escape sequences are supported; refer to Display file
           escape sequences in tnftpd(8) for more information.  If file is a
           relative path, it will be searched for in /etc (which can be over-
           ridden with -c confdir).

     notify class [fileglob]
           If fileglob is not specified or class is ``none'', disable this.
           Otherwise, each time the user enters a new directory, notify the
           user of any files matching fileglob.

     passive class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, prevent passive (PASV,
           LPSV, and EPSV) connections.  Otherwise, enable them.

     portrange class [min max]
           Set the range of port number which will be used for the passive
           data port.  max must be greater than min, and both numbers must be
           be between IPPORT_RESERVED (1024) and 65535.  If class is ``none''
           or no arguments are specified, disable this.

     private class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, do not display class
           information in the output of the STAT command.  Otherwise, display
           the information.

     rateget class [rate]
           Set the maximum get (RETR) transfer rate throttle for class to rate
           bytes per second.  If rate is 0, the throttle is disabled.  If
           class is ``none'' or rate is not specified, disable this.

           An optional suffix may be provided, which changes the interpreta-
           tion of rate as follows:
                 b    Causes no modification.  (Default; optional)
                 k    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
                 m    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
                 g    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824
                 t    Tera; multiply the argument by 1099511627776

     rateput class [rate]
           Set the maximum put (STOR) transfer rate throttle for class to rate
           bytes per second, which is parsed as per rateget rate.  If class is
           ``none'' or rate is not specified, disable this.

     readsize class [size]
           Set the size of the read buffer to read(2) a file.  The default is
           the file system block size.  An optional suffix may be provided as
           per rateget.  This option affects only binary transfers.  If class
           is ``none'' or size is not specified, use the default.

     recvbufsize class [size]
           Set the size of the socket receive buffer.  An optional suffix may
           be provided as per rateget.  The default is zero and the system
           default value will be used.  This option affects only passive
           transfers.  If class is ``none'' or size is not specified, use the
           default.

     sanenames class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, allow uploaded file names
           to contain any characters valid for a file name.  Otherwise, only
           permit file names which don't start with a `.' and only comprise of
           characters from the set ``[-+,._A-Za-z0-9]''.

     sendbufsize class [size]
           Set the size of the socket send buffer.  An optional suffix may be
           provided as per rateget.  The default is zero and the system
           default value will be used.  This option affects only binary trans-
           fers.  If class is ``none'' or size is not specified, use the
           default.

     sendlowat class [size]
           Set the low water mark of socket send buffer.  An optional suffix
           may be provided as per rateget.  The default is zero and system
           default value will be used.  This option affects only for binary
           transfer.  If class is ``none'' or size is not specified, use the
           default.

     template class [refclass]
           Define refclass as the `template' for class; any reference to
           refclass in following directives will also apply to members of
           class.  This is useful to define a template class so that other
           classes which are to share common attributes can be easily defined
           without unnecessary duplication.  There can be only one template
           defined at a time.  If refclass is not specified, disable the tem-
           plate for class.

     timeout class [time]
           Set the inactivity timeout period.  (the default is fifteen min-
           utes).  This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or greater than the
           value for maxtimeout.  If class is ``none'' or time is not speci-
           fied, use the default.

     umask class [umaskval]
           Set the umask to umaskval.  If class is ``none'' or umaskval is not
           specified, set to the default of 027.

     upload class [off]
           If class is ``none'' or off is specified, disable the following
           commands: APPE, STOR, and STOU, as well as the modify commands:
           CHMOD, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNFR, and UMASK.  Otherwise, enable them.

     writesize class [size]
           Limit the number of bytes to write(2) at a time.  The default is
           zero, which means all the data available as a result of mmap(2) or
           read(2) will be written at a time.  An optional suffix may be pro-
           vided as per rateget.  This option affects only binary transfers.
           If class is ``none'' or size is not specified, use the default.
