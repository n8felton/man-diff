SLAPD-LDBM(5)                                                    SLAPD-LDBM(5)



NAME
       slapd-ldbm - LDBM backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The LDBM backend to slapd(8) is an easy-to-configure but obsolete data-
       base backend.  It does not offer the data durability  features  of  the
       BDB  and  HDB  backends  and hence is considered deprecated in favor of
       these robust backends.  LDBM uses  lightweight  non-transactional  data
       interfaces,  such  as  those  provided by GDBM or Berkeley DB, to store
       data.  It makes extensive use of indexing and  caching  to  speed  data
       access.

CONFIGURATION
       These  slapd.conf options apply to the LDBM backend database.  That is,
       they must follow a "database ldbm" line and come before any  subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       cachesize <integer>
              Specify the size in entries of the in-memory cache maintained by
              the  LDBM  backend  database  instance.   The  default  is  1000
              entries.

       dbcachesize <integer>
              Specify the size in bytes of the in-memory cache associated with
              each  open index file.  If not supported by the underlying data-
              base method,  this  option  is  ignored  without  comment.   The
              default is 100000 bytes.

       dbnolocking
              Specify  that no database locking should be performed.  Enabling
              this option may improve performance at the expense of data secu-
              rity.  Do NOT run any slap tools while slapd is running.

       dbnosync
              Specify that on-disk database contents should not be immediately
              synchronized with in memory changes.  Enabling this  option  may
              improve performance at the expense of data security.

       dbsync <frequency> <maxdelays> <delayinterval>
              Flush  dirty  database  buffers to disk every <seconds> seconds.
              Implies dbnosync (ie. individual updates are no  longer  written
              to  disk).   It  attempts  to avoid syncs during periods of peak
              activity by waiting <delayinterval> seconds  if  the  server  is
              busy,  repeating  this delay up to <maxdelays> times before pro-
              ceeding.  It is an attempt to provide higher  write  performance
              with  some  amount  of data security.  Note that it may still be
              possible to get  an  inconsistent  database  if  the  underlying
              engine fills its cache and writes out individual pages and slapd
              crashes or is killed before  the  next  sync.   <maxdelays>  and
              <delayinterval>  are  optional  and  default to 12 and 5 respec-
              tively, giving a total elapsed delay of 60 seconds before a sync
              will  occur.   <maxdelays> may be zero, and <delayinterval> must
              be 1 or greater.

       directory <directory>
              Specify the directory where the LDBM files containing this data-
              base  and associated indexes live.  A separate directory must be
              specified for each  database.   The  default  is  /var/db/openl-
              dap/openldap-data.

       index {<attrlist>|default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,<special>]
              Specify the indexes to maintain for the given attribute (or list
              of attributes).   Some  attributes  only  support  a  subset  of
              indexes.   If only an <attr> is given, the indices specified for
              default are maintained.  Note that setting a  default  does  not
              imply  that  all attributes will be indexed. Also, for best per-
              formance, an eq  index  should  always  be  configured  for  the
              objectClass attribute.

              A  number  of  special  index  parameters may be specified.  The
              index type sub can be decomposed  into  subinitial,  subany, and
              subfinal  indices.   The  special type notags (or nolang) may be
              specified to disallow use of this index by subtypes with tagging
              options (such as language options).  The special type nosubtypes
              may be specified to disallow use of this  index  by  named  sub-
              types.    Note:  changing  index  settings  requires  rebuilding
              indices, see slapindex(8).

       mode <integer>
              Specify the file protection mode  that  newly  created  database
              index files should have.  The default is 0600.

ACCESS CONTROL
       The  ldbm  backend  honors  access  control  semantics  as indicated in
       slapd.access(5).
