NAME
     securenet -- ypserv(8) configuration file for secure networks

DESCRIPTION
     The securenet file controls which hosts can connect to the YP server.

     The format is rather simple. Each row consists of two items. The first
     item is the network mask. The second item is the network.

EXAMPLES
     A configuration file might appear as follows:

     #
     # Only my local net is secure.
     #
     255.255.255.0 139.58.253.0

FILES
     /var/yp/securenet  A ypserv(8) configuration file.

SEE ALSO
     yp(8), ypserv(8), ypserv.acl(5)

HISTORY
     The securenet was added to NIS by Sun Microsystems, Inc. as a bugfix for
     weak security.
