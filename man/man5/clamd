NAME
       clamd.conf - Configuration file for Clam AntiVirus Daemon

DESCRIPTION
       clamd.conf configures the Clam AntiVirus daemon, clamd(8).

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists  of  comments and options with arguments. Each line
       which starts with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the  parser.  Options
       and  arguments  are case sensitive and of the form Option Argument. The
       arguments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no or true/false or 1/0).

       STRING String without blank characters.

       SIZE   Size in bytes. You can use 'M' or 'm'  modifiers  for  megabytes
              and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes.

       NUMBER Unsigned integer.

DIRECTIVES
       When some option is not used (commented out or not included in the con-
       figuration file at all) clamd takes a default action.

       Example
              If this option is set clamd will not run.

       StreamMaxLength SIZE
              Clamd  uses  FTP-like  protocol  to  receive  data  from  remote
              clients. If you are using clamav-milter to balance load  between
              remote  clamd  daemons  on firewall servers you may need to tune
              the Stream* options. This option allows you to specify the upper
              limit  for  data  size  that will be transfered to remote daemon
              when scanning a single file. It should match  your  MTA's  limit
              for a maximum attachment size.
              Default: 10M

       StreamMinPort NUMBER
              Limit data port range.
              Default: 1024

              Detect Possibly Unwanted Applications.
              Default: No

       ExcludePUA CATEGORY
              Exclude a specific PUA category. This directive can be used mul-
              tiple times. See http://www.clamav.net/support/pua for the  com-
              plete list of PUA categories.
              Default: Load all categories (if DetectPUA is activated)

       IncludePUA CATEGORY
              Only include a specific PUA category. This directive can be used
              multiple times. See  http://www.clamav.net/support/pua  for  the
              complete list of PUA categories.
              Default: Load all categories (if DetectPUA is activated)

       AlgorithmicDetection BOOL
              In  some  cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files,
              and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide  accurate
              detection. This option controls the algorithmic detection.
              Default: yes

       ScanPE BOOL
              PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file for-
              mat used in all 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows operating sys-
              tems.  This option allows ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of
              executable files and it's also  required  for  decompression  of
              popular executable packers such as UPX.
              Default: yes

       ScanELF BOOL
              Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X exe-
              cutables. This option allows you to control the scanning of  ELF
              files.
              Default: yes

       DetectBrokenExecutables BOOL
              With  this  option  clamd  will try to detect broken executables
              (both PE and ELF) and mark them as Broken.Executable.
              Default: no

       ScanOLE2 BOOL
              This option enables scanning of OLE2 files,  such  as  Microsoft
              Office documents and .msi files.
              Default: yes

       ScanPDF BOOL
              This option enables scanning within PDF files.
              Default: yes

       ScanHTML BOOL
              Enables HTML detection and normalisation.
              Default: yes

              Enable scanning of mail files.
              Default: yes

       MailFollowURLs BOOL
              If  an  email  contains  URLs ClamAV can download and scan them.
              WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack. Never
              use it on loaded servers.
              Default: no

       ScanPartialMessages BOOL
              Scan  RFC1341  messages split over many emails. You will need to
              periodically clean up $TemporaryDirectory/clamav-partial  direc-
              tory. WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack.
              Never use it on loaded servers.
              Default: no

       MailMaxRecursion NUMBER (OBSOLETE)
              WARNING: This option is no longer accepted. See MaxRecursion.

       PhishingSignatures BOOL
              With this option enabled ClamAV  will  try  to  detect  phishing
              attempts by using signatures.
              Default: yes

       PhishingScanURLs BOOL
              Scan URLs found in mails for phishing attempts using heuristics.
              This will classify "Possibly Unwanted" phishing emails as Phish-
              ing.Heuristics.Email.*
              Default: yes

       PhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch BOOL
              Always  block  SSL  mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in
              the database. This can lead to false positives.
              Default: no

       PhishingAlwaysBlockCloak BOOL
              Always block cloaked URLs, even if URL isn't in  database.  This
              can lead to false positives.
              Default: no

       HeuristicScanPrecedence BOOL
              Allow  heuristic  match  to  take precedence. When enabled, if a
              heuristic  scan  (such  as  phishingScan)  detects  a   possible
              virus/phishing  it  will stop scanning immediately. Recommended,
              saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phishing  detected  by
              heuristic  scans  will be reported only at the end of a scan. If
              an archive contains both a heuristically  detected  virus/phish-
              ing, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported. Keep
              this disabled if you intend to handle  "*.Heuristics.*"  viruses
              differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected
              virus (signature-based) is found first, the scan is  interrupted
              immediately, regardless of this config option.
              Default: no

       StructuredMinSSNCount NUMBER
              This option sets the lowest number of  Social  Security  Numbers
              found in a file to generate a detect.
              Default: 3

              Default: Yes

       StructuredSSNFormatStripped BOOL
              With this option enabled the DLP module will  search  for  valid
