NAME
       freshclam.conf  - Configuration file for Clam AntiVirus database update
       tool

DESCRIPTION
       The file freshclam.conf configures the Clam AntiVirus Database Updater,
       freshclam(1).

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists  of  comments and options with arguments. Each line
       which starts with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the  parser.  Options
       and  arguments  are case sensitive and of the form Option Argument. The
       arguments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no or true/false or 1/0).

       STRING String without blank characters.

       SIZE   Size in bytes. You can use 'M' or 'm'  modifiers  for  megabytes
              and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes.

       NUMBER Unsigned integer.

DIRECTIVES
       When  an  option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configura-
       tion file) freshclam takes a default action.

       Example
              If this option is set freshclam will not run.

       DatabaseOwner STRING
              When started by root, drop privileges to a specified user.
              Default: _clamav

       AllowSupplementaryGroups BOOL
              Initialize supplementary group access (freshclam must be started
              by root).
              Default: disabled

       DatabaseDirectory STRING
              Path to a directory containing database files.
              Default: /private/var/clamav

       Checks NUMBER
              Number of database checks per day.
              Default: 12

       UpdateLogFile STRING
              Enable logging to a specified file. Highly recommended.
              Default: disabled.

       LogFileMaxSize SIZE
              Limit the size of the log file. The logger will be automatically
              disabled if the file is greater than SIZE. Value of  0  disables
              the limit.
              Default: 1M

       LogSyslog BOOL
              Enable  logging  to  Syslog.  May  be  used  in combination with
              UpdateLogFile.
              Default: disabled.

       LogFacility STRING
              Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man  sys-
              log' for facility names.
              Default: LOG_LOCAL6

       PidFile STRING
              This  option  allows  you  to save the process identifier of the
              daemon to a file specified in the argument.
              Default: disabled

       LogVerbose BOOL
              Enable verbose logging.
              Default: disabled

       DNSDatabaseInfo STRING
              This directive enables  database  and  software  version  checks
              through DNS TXT records.
              Default: enabled, pointing to current.cvd.clamav.net

       DatabaseMirror STRING
              Server name where database updates are downloaded from. In order
              to download the database from the closest mirror you should con-
              figure  freshclam  to  use  db.xy.clamav.net where xy represents
              your country code. If  this  option  is  given  multiple  times,
              freshclam(1) tries them in the order given. It's strongly recom-
              mended that you use db.xy.clamav.net as  the  first  mirror  and
              database.clamav.net as the second.
              Default: database.clamav.net

       MaxAttempts NUMBER

              Default: 3 (per mirror)

       ScriptedUpdates BOOL
              With  this  option you can control scripted updates. It's highly
              recommended to keep it enabled.
              Default: enabled

       TestDatabases BOOL
              With this option enabled, freshclam will  attempt  to  load  new
              databases  into memory to make sure they are properly handled by
              libclamav before replacing the old ones.
              Default: enabled

       CompressLocalDatabase BOOL
              By default freshclam will keep the local databases (.cld) uncom-
              pressed  to make their handling faster. With this option you can
              enable the compression; the change will  take  effect  with  the
              next database update.
              Default: no

       HTTPProxyServer STR, HTTPProxyPort NUMBER
              Use given proxy server and TCP port for database downloads.

       HTTPProxyUsername STR,HTTPProxyPassword STRING
              Proxy  usage  is  authenticated through given username and pass-
              word.
              Default: no proxy authentication

       HTTPUserAgent STRING
              If your servers are behind a firewall/proxy which applies  User-
              Agent  filtering,  you can use this option to force the use of a
              different User-Agent header.
              Default: clamav/version_number

       LocalIPAddress IP
              Use IP as client address for downloading databases.  Useful  for
              multi homed systems.
              Default: Use OS'es default outgoing IP address.

       NotifyClamd STRING
              Notify  a  running clamd(8) to reload its database after a down-
              load has occurred. The path for clamd.conf  file  must  be  pro-
              vided.
              Default: The default is to not notify clamd. See clamd.conf(5)'s
              option SelfCheck for how clamd(8) handles  database  updates  in
              this case.

       OnUpdateExecute STRING
              Execute  this  command  after the database has been successfully
              updated.
              Default: disabled

       OnOutdatedExecute STRING
              Execute this command when freshclam reports outdated version. In
              the  command  string %v will be replaced by the new version num-
              ber.
              Default: disabled

       OnErrorExecute STRING
              Execute this command after a database update has failed.
              Default: disabled

       ConnectTimeout NUMBER
              Timeout in seconds when connecting to database server.
              Default: 10

       ReceiveTimeout NUMBER
              Timeout in seconds when reading from database server.
              Default: 30

       SubmitDetectionStats STRING
              When enabled freshclam will  submit  statistics  to  the  ClamAV
              Project  about  the latest virus detections in your environment.
              The ClamAV maintainers will then use this data to determine what
              types  of malware are the most detected in the field and in what
              geographic area they are. This feature requires LogTime and Log-
              File  to  be enabled in clamd.conf. The path for clamd.conf file
              must be provided.
              Default: disabled

       DetectionStatsCountry STRING
              Country of origin of malware/detection statistics (for statisti-
              cal  purposes only). The statistics collector at ClamAV.net will
              look up your IP address to determine the geographical origin  of
              the  malware reported by your installation. If this installation
              is mainly used to scan data which comes from a  different  loca-
              tion, please enable this option and enter a two-letter code (see
              http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/) of the country of  origin.
              Default: disabled

       DetectionStatsHostID STRING
              This  option  enables support for our "Personal Statistics" ser-
              vice. When this option is enabled, the  information  on  malware
              detected  by  your  clamd  installation is made available to you
              through   our   website.   To   get   your   HostID,   log    on
              http://www.stats.clamav.net  and  add  a  new  host to your host
              list. Once you have the HostID, uncomment this option and  paste
              the  HostID  here.  As  soon as your freshclam starts submitting
              information to our stats collecting service, you will be able to
              view  the  statistics of this clamd installation by logging into
              http://www.stats.clamav.net with the same credentials  you  used
              to   generate   the  HostID.  For  more  information  refer  to:
              http://www.clamav.net/support/faq/faq-cctts/.    This    feature
              requires SubmitDetectionStats to be enabled.
              Default: disabled

       SafeBrowsing BOOL
              This option enables support for Google Safe Browsing. When acti-
              vated for the first time, freshclam will download a new database
              file  (safebrowsing.cvd)  which  will be automatically loaded by
              clamd and clamscan during the next  reload,  provided  that  the
              heuristic   phishing  detection  is  turned  on.  This  database
              includes information about websites that may be  phishing  sites
              or  possible  sources  of  malware. When using this option, it's
              mandatory to run freshclam at least every 30 minutes.  Freshclam
              uses  the ClamAV's mirror infrastructure to distribute the data-
              base and its updates but all the  contents  are  provided  under
              Google's   terms   of   use.   See   http://code.google.com/sup-
              port/bin/answer.py?answer=70015   and   http://safebrowsing.cla-
              mav.net for more information.
              Default: disabled

       Bytecode BOOL
              This  option enables downloading of bytecode.cvd, which includes
              additional detection mechanisms and improvements to  the  ClamAV
              engine.
              Default: enabled
