NAME
       freshclam.conf  - Configuration file for Clam AntiVirus database update
       tool

DESCRIPTION
       The file freshclam.conf configures the Clam AntiVirus Database Updater,
       freshclam(1).

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists  of  comments and options with arguments. Each line
       which starts with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the  parser.  Options
       and  arguments  are case sensitive and of the form Option Argument. The
       arguments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no or true/false or 1/0).

       STRING String without blank characters.

       SIZE   Size in bytes. You can use 'M' or 'm'  modifiers  for  megabytes
              and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes.

       NUMBER Unsigned integer.

DIRECTIVES
       When  an  option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configura-
       tion file) freshclam takes a default action.

       Example
              If this option is set freshclam will not run.

              Default: _clamav

       AllowSupplementaryGroups BOOL
              Initialize supplementary group access (freshclam must be started
              by root).
              Default: disabled

       DatabaseDirectory STRING
              Path to a directory containing database files.

              Default: 12

              Default: disabled.

       LogSyslog BOOL

              UpdateLogFile.
              Default: disabled.

       LogFacility STRING
              Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man  sys-
              log' for facility names.
              Default: LOG_LOCAL6

       PidFile STRING
              This  option  allows  you  to save the process identifier of the
              daemon to a file specified in the argument.
              Default: disabled

       LogVerbose BOOL
              Enable verbose logging.
              Default: disabled

       DNSDatabaseInfo STRING
              This directive enables  database  and  software  version  checks
              through DNS TXT records.
              Default: enabled, pointing to current.cvd.clamav.net

       DatabaseMirror STRING
              Server name where database updates are downloaded from. In order
              to download the database from the closest mirror you should con-
              figure  freshclam  to  use  db.xy.clamav.net where xy represents
              your country code. If  this  option  is  given  multiple  times,
              freshclam(1) tries them in the order given. It's strongly recom-
              mended that you use db.xy.clamav.net as  the  first  mirror  and
              database.clamav.net as the second.
              Default: database.clamav.net

       MaxAttempts NUMBER
              How many attempts (per mirror) to make before giving up.
              Default: 3 (per mirror)

       ScriptedUpdates BOOL
              With  this  option you can control scripted updates. It's highly
              recommended to keep it enabled.
              Default: enabled

       CompressLocalDatabase BOOL
              By default freshclam will keep the local databases (.cld) uncom-
              pressed  to make their handling faster. With this option you can
              enable the compression; the change will  take  effect  with  the
              next database update.
              Default: no

              Use given proxy server and TCP port for database downloads.

       HTTPProxyUsername STR,HTTPProxyPassword STRING
              Proxy  usage  is  authenticated through given username and pass-
              word.
              Default: no proxy authentication

       HTTPUserAgent STRING
              If your servers are behind a firewall/proxy which applies  User-
              Agent  filtering,  you can use this option to force the use of a
              different User-Agent header.
              Default: clamav/version_number

       LocalIPAddress IP
              Use IP as client address for downloading databases.  Useful  for
              multi homed systems.
              Default: Use OS'es default outgoing IP address.

       NotifyClamd STRING
              Notify  a  running clamd(8) to reload its database after a down-
              load has occurred. The path for clamd.conf  file  must  be  pro-
              vided.
              Default: The default is to not notify clamd. See clamd.conf(5)'s
              option SelfCheck for how clamd(8) handles  database  updates  in
              this case.

       OnUpdateExecute STRING
              Execute  this  command  after the database has been successfully
