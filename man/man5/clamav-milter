NAME
       clamav-milter.conf - Configuration file for clamav-milter

DESCRIPTION
       clamav-milter.conf  contains  the configuration options for clamav-mil-
       ter(8).

FILE FORMAT
       The file consists of comments and options  with  arguments.  Each  line
       which  starts  with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options
       and arguments are case sensitive and of the form Option  Argument.  The
       arguments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no or true/false or 1/0).

       STRING String without blank characters.

       SIZE   Size  in  bytes.  You can use 'M' or 'm' modifiers for megabytes
              and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes.

       NUMBER Unsigned integer.

MAIN OPTIONS
       Example
              If this option is set clamav-milter will not run.

       MilterSocket STRING
              Define the interface through which we communicate with sendmail.
              This option is mandatory!
              Possible formats are:
              [[unix|local]:]/path/to/file - to specify a unix domain socket
              inet:port@[hostname|ip-address] - to specify an ipv4 socket
              inet6:port@[hostname|ip-address] - to specify an ipv6 socket
              Default: unset

       MilterSocketGroup STRING
              Define the group ownership for the (unix) milter socket.
              Default: disabled (the primary group of the user running clamd)

       MilterSocketMode STRING
              Sets  the  permissions on the (unix) milter socket to the speci-
              fied mode.
              Default: disabled (obey umask)

       FixStaleSocket BOOL
              Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
              Default: yes

       User STRING
              Run as another user (clamav-milter must be started by  root  for
              this option to work)
              Default: unset (don't drop privileges)

       AllowSupplementaryGroups BOOL
              Initialize  supplementary  group  access  (clamav-milter must be
              started by root).
              Default: no

       ReadTimeout NUMBER
              Waiting for data from clamd will timeout after this  time  (sec-
              onds).
              Default: 120

       Foreground BOOL
              Don't fork into background.
              Default: no

       Chroot STRING
              Chroot  to  the specified directory. Chrooting is performed just
              after reading the config file and before dropping privileges.
              Default: unset (don't chroot)

       PidFile STRING
              Save the process identifier of a clamav-milter (main thread)  to
              a specified file.
              Default: disabled

       TemporaryDirectory STRING
              Optional path to the global temporary directory.
              Default: system specific (usually /tmp or /var/tmp).

CLAMD OPTIONS
       ClamdSocket STRING
              Define  the clamd socket to connect to for scanning. This option
              is mandatory! Syntax:
              ClamdSocket unix:path
              ClamdSocket tcp:host:port
              The first syntax specifies a local unix socket (needs  an  abso-
              lute path) e.g.:
              ClamdSocket unix:/var/run/clamd/clamd.socket
              The  second  syntax  specifies a tcp local or remote tcp socket:
              the host can be a hostname or an ip address; the  ":port"  field
              is  only  required  for IPv6 addresses, otherwise it defaults to
              3310 e.g.:
              ClamdSocket tcp:192.168.0.1
              This option can be repeated several times with different sockets
              or  even with the same socket: clamd servers will be selected in
              a round-robin fashion.
              Default: no default

EXCLUSIONS
       LocalNet STRING
              Messages originating  from  these  hosts/networks  will  not  be
              scanned.  This option takes a host(name)/mask pair in CIRD nota-
              tion and can be repeated several times. If "/mask" is omitted, a
              host is assumed. To specify a locally orignated, non-smtp, email
              use the keyword "local"
              Default: unset (scan everything regardless of the origin)

       Whitelist STRING
              This option specifies a file which  contains  a  list  of  basic
              POSIX  regular  expressions.  Addresses  (sent  to or from - see
              below) matching these regexes  will not be scanned.   Optionally
              each  line  can start with the string "From:" or "To:" (note: no
              whitespace after the colon) indicating if it is,   respectively,
              the  sender or recipient that is to be whitelisted. If the field
              is missing, "To:" is assumed.  Lines starting with #, : or ! are
              ignored.
              Default: unset (no exclusion applied)

       SkipAuthenticated STRING
              Messages  from  authenticated  SMTP users matching this extended
              POSIX regular expression (egrep-like) will not be  scanned.   As
              an  alternative,  a  file containing a plain (not regex) list of
              names (one per line) can be specified using the prefix  "file:".
              e.g.  SkipAuthenticated  file:/etc/good_guys.  Note: this is the
              AUTH login name!
              Default: unset (no whitelisting based on SMTP auth)

       MaxFileSize SIZE
              Messages larger than this value won't be scanned. Make sure this
              value is lower or equal than StreamMaxLength in clamd.conf
              Default: 25M

ACTIONS
       The  following  group  of  options controls the delievery process under
       different circumstances. The following actions are available:
       - Accept: The message is accepted for delievery
       - Reject: Immediately refuse delievery (a 5xx error is returned to  the
       peer)
       - Defer: Return a temporary failure message (4xx) to the peer
       -  Blackhole (not available for OnFail): Like Accept but the message is
       sent to oblivion
       - Quarantine (not available for OnFail): Like  Accept  but  message  is
       quarantined  instead  of being delivered. NOTE: In Sendmail the quaran-
       tine queue can be examined via mailq -qQ. For Postfix this  causes  the
       message to be placed on hold.

       OnClean STRING
              Action  to  be  performed  on  clean messages (mostly useful for
              testing)
              Default: Accept

       OnInfected STRING
              Action to be performed on infected messages
              Default: Quarantine

       OnFail STRING
              Action to be performed on error conditions (this includes  fail-
              ure  to allocate data structures, no scanners available, network
              timeouts, unknown scanner replies and the like)
              Default: Defer

       RejectMsg STRING
              This option allows  to  set  a  specific  rejection  reason  for
              infected  messages  and it's therefore only useful together with
              "OnInfected Reject".  The  string  "%v",  if  present,  will  be
              replaced with the virus name.
              Default: MTA specific

       AddHeader STRING
              If  this  option  is  set  to "Replace" (or "Yes"), an "X-Virus-
              Scanned" and an "X-Virus-Status" headers  will  be  attached  to
              each processed message, possibly replacing existing headers.  If
              it is set to Add, the X-Virus headers are added possibly on  top
              of  the existing ones. Note that while "Replace" can potentially
              break DKIM signatures, "Add" may confuse  procmail  and  similar
              filters.
              Default: no

       ReportHostname STRING
              When  AddHeader  is  in use, this option allows to arbitrary set
              the reported hostname. This may be desirable in order  to  avoid
              leaking  internal names. If unset the real machine name is used.
              Default: disabled

       VirusAction STRING
              Execute a command (possibly searching  PATH)  when  an  infected
              message  is  found.  The  following parameters are passed to the
              invoked program in this order: virus  name,  queue  id,  sender,
              destination,  subject,  message  id, message date. Note #1: this
              requires MTA macroes to be available  (see  LogInfected  below).
              Note #2: the process is invoked in the context of clamav-milter.
              Note #3: clamav-milter will wait for the  process  to  exit.  Be
              quick or fork to avoid unnecessary delays in email delievery.
              Default: disabled

LOGGING OPTIONS
       LogFile STRING
              Enable logging to selected file.
              Default: no

       LogFileUnlock BOOL
              Disable  a  system lock that protects against running clamd with
              the same configuration file multiple times.
              Default: no

       LogFileMaxSize SIZE
              Limit the size of the log file. The logger will be automatically
              disabled  if  the file is greater than SIZE. Value of 0 disables
              the limit.
              Default: 1M

       LogTime BOOL
              Log time for each message.
              Default: no

       LogSyslog BOOL
              Use system logger (can work together with LogFile).
              Default: no

       LogFacility STRING
              Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man  sys-
              log' for facility names.
              Default: LOG_LOCAL6

       LogVerbose BOOL
              Enable verbose logging.
              Default: no

       LogInfected STRING
              Specify  the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man sys-
              log' for facility names.
              This option allows to tune what is  logged  when  a  message  is
              infected.  Possible  values  are  Off  (the default - nothing is
              logged), Basic (minimal info logged), Full (verbose info logged)
              Note:  For  this  to  work  properly  in sendmail, make sure the
              msg_id, mail_addr, rcpt_addr and i macroes are available in eom.
              In  other  words  add  a  line like: Milter.macros.eom={msg_id},
              {mail_addr}, {rcpt_addr}, i to your .cf file. Alternatively  use
              the     macro:     define(`confMILTER_MACROS_EOM',    `{msg_id},
              {mail_addr}, {rcpt_addr}, i')
              Postfix should be working fine with the default settings.
              Default: disabled

NOTES
       All options expressing a size are limited to max 4GB. Values in  excess
       will be resetted to the maximum.
