VARIABLES(5)                       Net-SNMP                       VARIABLES(5)



NAME
           variables - Format of specifying variable names to SNMP tools.

SYNOPSIS
           system.sysdescr.0

DESCRIPTION
       Variable  names are in the format of Object Identifiers (ASN.1).  There
       are several methods of representation. Each variable name is  given  in
       the  format  of  A.B.C.D..., where A, B, C, and D are subidentifiers in
       one of two forms of notation.  Each subidentifier may be encoded  as  a
       decimal  integer, or a symbol as found in the RFC1066 MIB.  The case of
       the symbols is not significant.
       If there is no leading "." in the  variable  name,  the  name  will  be
       formed   as   if   having   been   preceded   with  "iso.org.dod.inter-
       net.mgmt.mib.".  A "." must be placed before the first variable if  the
       user is to fully specify the name.  For example:

       1.1.0 system.sysDescr.0 and 1.sysDescr.0

       all refer to the same variable name.  Likewise:

       .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0     .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib.system.sysdescr.0
       .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.sysdescr.0

       All refer to the same variable name.

       The description of the variables in the MIB is given in the set of  MIB
       files  defined  by  the  MIBS environment variable (or the default list
       defined   at   compilation   time)   and   the   MIB   files   in   the
       /usr/share/snmp/mibs directory (or the MIBDIRS environment variable).

SEE ALSO
       RFC 1065, RFC 1066, RFC 1067, ISO IS 8824(ASN.1)

BUGS
       The  parser  of  the  MIB  files file is not expected to handle bizarre
       (although correct) interpretations of the ASN.1 notation.
