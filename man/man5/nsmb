NAME
     nsmb.conf -- configuration file for SMB requests

DESCRIPTION
     The nsmb.conf file contains information about the computers, users, and
     shares or mount points for the SMB network protocol.

     The configuration hierarchy is made up of several sections, each section
     containing a few or several lines of parameters and their assigned val-
     ues.  Each of these sections must begin with a section name enclosed
     within square brackets, similar to:

           [section_name]

     The end of each section is marked by either the start of a new section,
     or by the abrupt ending of the file, commonly referred to as the EOF.
     Each section may contain zero or more parameters such as:

           [section_name]
           key=value

     where key represents a parameter name, and value would be the parameter's
     assigned value.

     The SMB library uses the following information for section names:

     A)      [default]
     B)      [SERVER]
     C)      [SERVER:USER]
     D)      [SERVER:USER:SHARE]

     Possible keywords may include:

     Keyword        Section    Comment
                    A B C D
     addr           - + - -    IP address of the SMB server
     dos charsets   + - - -    dos charset
     nbns           + + - -    address of NetBIOS name server (WINS)
     nbscope        + + - -    NetBIOS scope
     nbtimeout      + + - -    timeout for NetBIOS name servers
     port445        + + - -    how to use SMB TCP/UDP ports
     minauth        + + - -    minimum authentication level allowed
     streams        + + - -    use NTFS Streams if supported by the server
     soft           + + - -    Make the mount soft.  Fail file system calls
                               after a number of seconds.
     domain         + + + +    The domain name to use when logging into the
                               server.

     The minimum authentication level can be one of:

     kerberos  Kerberos - NTLMv2, NTLM, LM, and plain-text password authenti-
               cation are not attempted.

     ntlmv2    NTLMv2 - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos
               token can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is
               attempted; if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords,
               the authentication fails.

     ntlm      NTLM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token
               can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted
               and, if that fails, NTLMv1 authentication is attempted, with
               zeroes in the LM hash; if the server doesn't support encrypted
               passwords, the authentication fails.

     lm        LM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token
               can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted
               and, if that fails, NTLMv1 authentication is attempted, includ-
               ing the LM hash; if the server doesn't support encrypted pass-
               words, the authentication fails.

     none      none - The same as lm except that, if the server doesn't sup-
               port encrypted passwords, plain-text passwords are used.

     (Note: "NetBIOS" as used below means "NetBIOS over TCP/IP.")

     "how to use SMB TCP/UDP ports" can be one of:

     normal        (default) Attempt to connect via port 445. If that is
                   unsuccessful, try to connect via NetBIOS.

     netbios_only  Do not attempt to connect via port 445.

     no_netbios    Attempt to connect via port 445. If that is unsuccessful,
                   do not try to connect via NetBIOS.

FILES
     /etc/nsmb.conf  The global configuration file.

     ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf
                     The user's configuration file, conflicts will be over-
                     written by the global file.

EXAMPLES
     What follows is a sample configuration file which may, or may not match
     your environment:

           # Configuration file for example.com
           [default]
           minauth=ntlmv2
           streams=yes
           soft=yes
           domain=DOMAIN
           [WIN98]
           addr=windows98.apple.com

     All lines which begin with the `#' character are comments and will not be
     parsed.  The ``default'' section specifies that only Kerberos and NTLMv2
     authentication should be attempted; NTLM authentication should not be
     attempted if NTLMv2 authentication fails, and plain-text authentication
     should not be attempted if the server doesn't support encrypted pass-
     words.
