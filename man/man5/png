NAME
       png - Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format

DESCRIPTION
       PNG  (Portable  Network  Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
       lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG  pro-
       vides  a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many com-
       mon uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and  truecolor  images  are
       supported,  plus  an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1
       to 16 bits.

       PNG is designed to work well in online viewing  applications,  such  as
       the  World  Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive dis-
       play option. PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking
       and fast, simple detection of common transmission errors. Also, PNG can
       store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching  on  het-
       erogeneous platforms.
