NAME
     asl.conf -- configuration file for syslogd(8) asl_action module.

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogd(8) server in Mac OS X includes a module that compares mes-
     sages with a set of query patterns, and which performs various actions
     when messages match the query patterns.

     Each line in the file contains three components.  The first is a query,
     the second is an action, and the third contains parameters specific to
     that action.  For example:

           Q [= Sender foobar] [N< Level 3] notify com.apple.foobar

   Queries
     Queries start with the letter "Q" followed by whitespace.  Following that
     are any number of message matching components, each of which has the
     form:

           [OP KEY VAL]

     OP is a comparison operator.  It can have the following values:

           T     true (always matches)
           =     equal
           !     not equal
           >     greater than
           >=    greater than or equal to
           <     less than
           <=    less than or equal to

     It can also be preceded by one or more modifiers:

           C     casefold
           N     numeric comparison
           S     substring
           A     prefix
           Z     suffix

     KEY and VAL are message keys and values.  For example

           Q [= Sender foobar]

     matches any message with key="Sender" and val="foobar".  The query

           Q [CA= Color gr]

     matches any message with key=Color and val beginning with the letters GR,
     Gr, gr, or gR (C meaning casefold, A meaning prefix).  The example query
     above,

           Q [= Sender foobar] [N< Level 3]

     matches any message from "foobar" with a level numerically less than 3
     (string values are converted to integers, and the comparison is done on
     the integer values).

     The "T" operator is useful to test for the presence of a particular key.

           Q [T Flavor whatever]

     Will match any message that has a "Flavor" key, regardless of its value.

   Actions
     The "notify" action causes syslogd to post a notification with
     notify_post().  The notification key must appear as a single parameter
     following the "notify" action.

     The "access" action sets read access controls for messages that match the
     associated query pattern.  syslogd will restrict read access to matching
     messages to a specific user and group.  The user ID number and group ID
     number must follow the "access" keyword as parameters.

     The "store" action saves matching messages in a separate log message
     database.  The database may be accessed using the syslog command line
     utility.  A database pathname must follow the "store" keyword.  A new
     database will be created if one does not exist.  Two optional parameters,
     "stayopen" and "exclude_asldb" may follow the database pathname.

     By default, syslogd will open the database, save a matching message, and
     then close the database.  If a high volume of messages is expected, spec-
     ifying "stayopen" will improve performance.

     Specifying "exclude_asldb" will cause syslogd to save matching messages
     in the database, but exclude them from the main syslogd database
     (/var/log/asl.db).
