NAME
       snmp.conf - snmp configuration file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The  snmp.conf  file configures the CUPS SNMP printer discovery backend
       and is  normally located in the /etc/cups directory. Each line  in  the
       file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Com-
       ment lines start with the # character.

       The SNMP backend uses the SNMPv1 protocol to discover network printers,
       collecting  information  from  the Host MIB along with intelligent port
       probes to determine the correct device URI and make and model for  each
       printer. Future versions of CUPS will likely support the new Port Moni-
       tor MIB as well.

DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by the SNMP  backend.   Consult
       the on-line help for detailed descriptions:

       Address @IF(name)

       Address @LOCAL

       Address address
            Sends  SNMP  broadcast  queries  to the specified address(es). The
            default address is "@LOCAL" which broadcasts  to  all  LAN  inter-
            faces.

       Community name
            Specifies  a  SNMP  community  to  query. The default community is
            "public".

       DebugLevel N
            Sets the debug logging level to N; 0  disables  debug  logging,  1
            enables  basic logging, 2 displays SNMP values, and 3 displays raw
            hex data.

       HostNameLookups on

       HostNameLookups off
            Specifies whether the addresses of printers should be converted to
            hostnames or left as numeric IP addresses. The default is "off".

       MaxRunTime seconds
            Specifies the maximum number of seconds that the SNMP backend will
            scan the network for printers.
