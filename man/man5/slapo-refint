SLAPO-REFINT(5)                                                SLAPO-REFINT(5)



NAME
       slapo-refint - Referential Integrity overlay

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  Referential  Integrity overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness  of  a  schema  which
       utilizes reference attributes.

       Integrity  is maintained by updating database records which contain the
       named attributes to match the results of a modrdn or delete  operation.
       For  example,  if  the  integrity attribute were configured as manager,
       deletion  of  the  record  "uid=robert,ou=people,o=openldap.org"  would
       trigger  a  search for all other records which have a manager attribute
       containing that DN. Entries matching that search would have their  man-
       ager attribute removed.

CONFIGURATION
       These  slapd.conf  options  apply to the Referential Integrity overlay.
       They should appear after the overlay directive.

       refint_attributes <attribute...>
              Specify one or more attributes for which integrity will be main-
              tained as described above.

       refint_nothing <string>
              Specify  an arbitrary value to be used as a placeholder when the
              last value would otherwise be deleted from  an  attribute.  This
              can  be  useful in cases where the schema requires the existence
              of an attribute for which referential integrity is enforced. The
              attempted deletion of a required attribute will otherwise result
              in an Object Class Violation, causing the request to fail.
