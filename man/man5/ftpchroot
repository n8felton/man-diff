FTPUSERS(5)                 BSD File Formats Manual                FTPUSERS(5)

NAME
     ftpusers, ftpchroot -- tnftpd(8) access control file

DESCRIPTION
     The ftpusers file provides user access control for tnftpd(8) by defining
     which users may login.

     If the ftpusers file does not exist, all users are denied access.

     A ``\'' is the escape character; it can be used to escape the meaning of
     the comment character, or if it is the last character on a line, extends
     a configuration directive across multiple lines.  A ``#'' is the comment
     character, and all characters from it to the end of line are ignored
     (unless it is escaped with the escape character).

     The syntax of each line is:
           userglob[:groupglob][@host] [directive [class]]

     These elements are:

           userglob   matched against the user name, using fnmatch(3) glob
                      matching (e.g, `f*').

           groupglob  matched against all the groups that the user is a member
                      of, using fnmatch(3) glob matching (e.g, `*src').

           host       either a CIDR address (refer to inet_net_pton(3)) to
                      match against the remote address (e.g, `1.2.3.4/24'), or
                      an fnmatch(3) glob to match against the remote hostname
                      (e.g, `*.NetBSD.org').

           directive  If ``allow'' or ``yes'' the user is allowed access.  If
                      ``deny'' or ``no'', or directive is not given, the user
                      is denied access.

           class      defines the class to use in ftpd.conf(5).

     If class is not given, it defaults to one of the following:

           chroot  If there is a match in /etc/ftpchroot for the user.

           guest   If the user name is ``anonymous'' or `ftp'.

           real    If neither of the above is true.

     No further comparisons are attempted after the first successful match.
     If no match is found, the user is granted access.  This syntax is back-
     ward-compatible with the old syntax.

     If a user requests a guest login, the tnftpd(8) server checks to see that
     both ``anonymous'' and ``ftp'' have access, so if you deny all users by
     default, you will need to add both ``anonymous allow'' and ``ftp allow''
     to /etc/ftpusers in order to allow guest logins.

   /etc/ftpchroot
     The file /etc/ftpchroot is used to determine which users will have their
     session's root directory changed (using chroot(2)), either to the direc-
     tory specified in the ftpd.conf(5) chroot directive (if set), or to the
     home directory of the user.  If the file does not exist, the root direc-
     tory change is not performed.

     The syntax is similar to ftpusers, except that the class argument is
     ignored.  If there's a positive match, the session's root directory is
     changed.  No further comparisons are attempted after the first successful
     match.  This syntax is backward-compatible with the old syntax.
