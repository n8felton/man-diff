SLAPO-AUDITLOG(5)                                            SLAPO-AUDITLOG(5)



NAME
       slapo-auditlog - Audit Logging overlay

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given
       backend database to a specified log file. Changes are logged  as  stan-
       dard  LDIF,  with  an additional comment header giving the timestamp of
       the change and the identity of the user making the change.

       For Add and Modify operations the identity comes from the modifiersName
       associated  with  the  operation.  This  is  usually  the  same  as the
       requestor's identity, but may be set by other overlays to reflect other
       values.

CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the Audit Logging overlay.  It should
       appear after the overlay directive.

       auditlog <filename>
              Specify the fully qualified path for the log file.
