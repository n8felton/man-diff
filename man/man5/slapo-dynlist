SLAPO-DYNLIST(5)                                              SLAPO-DYNLIST(5)



NAME
       slapo-dynlist - Dynamic List overlay

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  dynlist overlay to slapd(8) allows expansion of dynamic groups and
       more.  Any time an entry with a specific objectClass is being returned,
       the  LDAP  URI-valued  occurrences of a specific attribute are expanded
       into the corresponding entries, and the values of the attributes listed
       in  the  URI are added to the original entry.  No recursion is allowed,
       to avoid potential infinite loops.  The  resulting  entry  must  comply
       with the LDAP data model, so constraints are enforced.  For example, if
       a SINGLE-VALUE attribute is listed, only the first value results in the
       final entry.


CONFIGURATION
       The  config directives that are specific to the dynlist overlay must be
       prefixed by dynlist-, to avoid potential conflicts with directives spe-
       cific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.


       overlay dynlist
              This directive adds the dynlist overlay to the current database,
              or to the frontend, if used before any  database  instantiation;
              see slapd.conf(5) for details.


       This slapd.conf configuration option is define for the dynlist overlay.
       It may have multiple occurrences, and it must appear after the  overlay
       directive.

       dynlist-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> [<member-ad>]
              The  value  <group-oc> is the name of the objectClass that trig-
              gers the dynamic expansion of the data.

              The value <URL-ad> is the name of the attributeDescription  that
              cointains  the  URI  that is expanded by the overlay; if none is
              present, no  expansion  occurs.   If  the  intersection  of  the
              attributes  requested  by  the search operation (or the asserted
              attribute for compares) and the attributes listed in the URI  is
              empty,  no expansion occurs for that specific URI.  It must be a
              subtype of labeledURI.

              The value <member-ad>  is  optional;  if  present,  the  overlay
              behaves  as  a dynamic group: this attribute will list the DN of
              the entries resulting from the internal search.  In  this  case,
              the  <attrs>  portion  of the URI must be absent, and the DNs of
              all the entries resulting from the  expansion  of  the  URI  are
              listed  as  values  of this attribute.  Compares that assert the
              value of the <member-ad> attribute of  entries  with  <group-oc>
              objectClass apply as if the DN of the entries resulting from the
              expansion of the URI were present in  the  <group-oc>  entry  as
              values of the <member-ad> attribute.

       The  dynlist  overlay  may  be  used with any backend, but it is mainly
       intended for use with local storage backends.  In case the  URI  expan-
       sion is very resource-intensive and occurs frequently with well-defined
       patterns, one should consider adding a proxycache later on in the over-
       lay stack.


EXAMPLE
       This example collects all the email addresses of a database into a sin-
       gle entry; first of all, make sure that slapd.conf contains the  direc-
       tives:


           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database <database>
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL

       and that slapd loads dynlist.la, if compiled as a run-time module; then
       add to the database an entry like

           dn: cn=Dynamic List,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: groupOfURLs
           cn: Dynamic List
           memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(objectClass=person)

       If no <attrs> are provided in the URI, all (non-operational) attributes
       are collected.

       This  example  implements  the  dynamic  group  feature  on  the member
       attribute:


           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database <database>
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member
