NAME
       cupsd.conf - server configuration file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The  cupsd.conf  file  configures  the CUPS scheduler, cupsd(8).  It is
       normally located in the /private/etc/cups directory.

       Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a  blank  line,
       or  a comment. Comment lines start with the # character. The configura-
       tion directives are intentionally similar to those used by the  popular
       Apache web server software and are described below.
