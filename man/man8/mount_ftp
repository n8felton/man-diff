MOUNT_FTP(8)              BSD System Manager's Manual             MOUNT_FTP(8)

NAME
     mount_ftp -- mount a FTP filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     mount_ftp [-o options] host[:port][/path] node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_ftp command mounts a FTP-enabled server directory at
     host[:port][/path] at the mount point indicated by node.

     The user ID for all files and folders is set to the user's real user ID.
     The group ID for all files and directories is set to unknown, and the
     permissions default to read and execute for user, group and other.

     The options are:

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option fol-
             lowed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. The rdonly
             option will be set even if it was not specified because mount_ftp
             does not allow files to be opened with write access on servers.

     host[:port][/path]
             The FTP-enabled server directory to mount as a volume. If port is
             not specified, then port 21 is used. If path is not specified,
             then the path "/" is used.

     node    Path to mount point.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to mount the FTP-enabled server
     directory ftp.apple.com/ at the mount point /Volumes/mntpnt/

           mount_ftp ftp.apple.com/ /Volumes/mntpnt/

     [ENOENT]           The server directory could not be mounted by mount_ftp
                        because the node path is invalid.

     [ENODEV]           The server directory could not be mounted by mount_ftp
                        because it is not FTP-enabled or because it does not
                        exist, or because node does not have proper access.
