NAME
       applemysqlcheckcnf - MySQL configuration upgrade tool

DESCRIPTION
       The applemysqlcheckcnf tool creates a MySQL config file which optimizes
       MySQL performance based on  available  system  memory.  The  tool  will
       install  the  config  file  as  /etc/my.cnf, unless a file by that name
       already   exists,   in   which   case   it   will   install    it    as
       /etc/my.cnf.default.  In the latter case, the optimized config file has
       no effect until it replaces the old /etc/my.cnf.

       The applemysqlcheckcnf tool is run automatically each time  MySQL  ser-
       vice is started and does not need to be run by the administrator.
