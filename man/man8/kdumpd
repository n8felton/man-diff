KDUMPD(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                KDUMPD(8)

NAME
     kdumpd -- Mac OS X remote kernel core dump server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/kdumpd [directory]

DESCRIPTION
     Kdumpd is a server which receives kernel states in the form of a core
     dump from a remote Mac OS X machine.  The kdumpd server operates on UDP
     port 1069, although this may be configurable in the future.  The server
     should be started by inetd(8).

     The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege,
     usually the user "nobody".  The directory specified as a server program
     argument in /etc/inetd.conf directs the server to store kernel cores in
     that directory and nowhere else.  The server returns an EEXIST error to
     the remote kernel if it receives a request for an existing file - i.e.
     only new files can be created. The server also disallows path specifica-
     tions in the incoming file name.

HISTORY
     The kdumpd command is based on Berkeley tftpd(8) by way of FreeBSD, with
     several modifications.
