VFS_CATIA(8)                                                      VFS_CATIA(8)



NAME
       vfs_catia - translate illegal characters in Catia filenames

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = catia

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The  Catia  CAD  package commonly creates filenames that use characters
       that are illegal in CIFS filenames. The vfs_catia VFS module implements
       a  fixed  character mapping so that these files can be shared with CIFS
       clients.

       This module is stackable.

EXAMPLES
       Map Catia filenames on the [CAD] share:


               [CAD]
            path = /data/cad
            vfs objects = catia


VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba suite.

       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
