accept(8)                         Apple Inc.                         accept(8)



NAME
       accept/reject - accept/reject jobs sent to a destination

SYNOPSIS
       accept [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] destination(s)
       reject [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -r reason ] des-
       tination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       accept instructs the printing system to accept print jobs to the speci-
       fied destinations.

       reject instructs the printing system to reject print jobs to the speci-
       fied destinations. The -r option sets the reason  for  rejecting  print
       jobs. If not specified the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by both accept and reject:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Sets the username that is sent when connecting to the server.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -r "reason"
            Sets the reason string that is shown for a printer that is reject-
            ing jobs.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to  con-
       tain  any  printable  character  except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also,
       printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The CUPS versions of accept and reject may ask the user for  an  access
       password  depending  on the printing system configuration. This differs
       from the System V versions which require the root user to execute these
       commands.
