SLATTACH(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              SLATTACH(8)

NAME
     slattach -- attach serial lines as network interfaces

SYNOPSIS
     Slattach ttyname [baudrate]

DESCRIPTION
     Slattach is used to assign a tty line to a network interface, and to
     define the network source and destination addresses.  The following oper-
     ands are supported by slattach:

     ttyname       Specifies the name of the tty device.  Ttyname should be a
                   string of the form `ttyXX', or `/dev/ttyXX'.

     baudrate      Specifies the speed of the connection. If not specified,
                   the default of 9600 is used.

     Only the super-user may attach a network interface.

     To detach the interface, use ``ifconfig interface-name down'' after
     killing off the slattach process.  Interface-name is the name that is
     shown by netstat(1)

EXAMPLES
           slattach ttyh8
           slattach /dev/tty01 4800

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the requested
     address is unknown, the user is not privileged and tried to alter an
     interface's configuration.

SEE ALSO
