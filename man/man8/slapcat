SLAPCAT(8C)                                                        SLAPCAT(8C)



NAME
       slapcat - SLAPD database to LDIF utility

SYNOPSIS
       /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-108.1~2/Root/usr/sbin/slapcat  [-v] [-c]
       [-g] [-d level] [-b suffix] [-n dbnum] [-a filter] [-s subtree-dn]  [-f
       slapd.conf] [-F confdir] [-l ldif-file]


DESCRIPTION
       Slapcat is used to generate an LDAP Directory Interchange Format (LDIF)
       output based upon the contents of a slapd(8) database.   It  opens  the
       given  database  determined by the database number or suffix and writes
       the corresponding LDIF to standard output or the specified file.  Data-
       bases  configured as subordinate of this one are also output, unless -g
       is specified.

       The LDIF generated by this tool is suitable for  use  with  slapadd(8).
       As  the  entries  are in database order, not superior first order, they
       cannot be loaded with ldapadd(1) without first being reordered.

OPTIONS
       -v     Enable verbose mode.

       -c     Enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -d level
              Enable debugging messages as defined by the specified level.

       -b suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to generate
              output for.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction  with  the  -n
              option.

       -n dbnum
              Generate output for the dbnum-th database listed in the configu-
              ration file.  The -n cannot be used in conjunction with  the  -b
              option.

       -a filter
              Only dump entries matching the asserted filter.  For example

              slapcat -a \
                  "(!(entryDN:dnSubtreeMatch:=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com))"

              will  dump  all but the "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" subtree of
              the "dc=example,dc=com" database.

       -s subtree-dn
              Only dump entries in the subtree specified by this DN.   Implies
              `-b subtree-dn' if no -b or -n option is given.

       -f slapd.conf
              Specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F confdir
              specify  a  config  directory.  If both -f and -F are specified,
              the config file will be read and converted to  config  directory
              format  and  written  to  the  specified  directory.  If neither
              option is specified, an  attempt  to  read  the  default  config
              directory  will  be made before trying to use the default config
              file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config
              file is ignored.

       -l ldif-file
              Write LDIF to specified file instead of standard output.

LIMITATIONS
       In general, your slapd(8) should not be running (at least, not in read-
       write mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the database.

EXAMPLES
       To make a text backup of your SLAPD database  and  put  it  in  a  file
       called ldif, give the command:

            /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-108.1~2/Root/usr/sbin/slapcat -l ldif
