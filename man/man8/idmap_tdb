NAME
       idmap_tdb - Samba's idmap_tdb Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The  idmap_tdb plugin is the default backend used by winbindd for stor-
       ing SID/uid/gid mapping tables and  implements  both  the  "idmap"  and
       "idmap alloc" APIs.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       range = low - high
          Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the back-
          end is authoritative. Note that the range commonly matches the allo-
          cation  range  due  to the fact that the same backend will store and
          retrieve SID/uid/gid mapping entries. If the  parameter  is  absent,
          Winbind  fail  over  to  use the "idmap uid" and "idmap gid" options
          from smb.conf.

IDMAP ALLOC OPTIONS
       range = low - high
          Defines the available matching uid and gid range from which winbindd
          can  allocate for users and groups. If the parameter is absent, Win-
          bind fail over to use the "idmap uid" and "idmap gid"  options  from
          smb.conf.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  is  equivalent to the pre-3.0.25 default idmap
       configuration using the "idmap backend = tdb" setting.


            [global]
                idmap domains = ALLDOMAINS
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:default = yes
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:backend = tdb
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:range   = 10000 - 50000

                idmap alloc backend = tdb
                idmap alloc config:range = 10000 - 50000

       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
