NAME
     kdcmond -- KDC monitoring daemon -- Open Directory Single Sign On

SYNOPSIS
     kdcmond [-n] [-s] [-d] [-v debug_level] [-c path]

DESCRIPTION
     kdcmond is an (AT&T) init-like process that launches, monitors, and
     relaunches the Kerberos KDC ( krb5kdc ) process. It also registers the
     KDC over Rendezvous using the following DNS records:

     TXT 7200 _kerberos.hostname.

     SRV 7200 _kerberos._udp.REALM.

     SRV 7200 _kerberos._tcp.REALM.

     When the network state changes kdcmond sends a SIGUSER1 signal to the
     krb5kdc process to notify the KDC to re-initlaize its network listeners.

OPTIONS
     -n       prevents kdcmond from daemonizing

     -d       prevents kdcmond from registering the KDC over Rendezvous

     -c path  provides an alternate location for the kdc.conf file, which will
              be passed to the krb5kdc process

     -v debug_level
              Sets the level of debugging information emitted by the daemon

     -s       sends the debug output from kdcmond to syslog

FILES
     /var/db/krb5kdc/kdc.conf
     The realm name and port numbers are read from this file

DIAGNOSTICS
     Debug level 1 provides status information, higher levels add progressivly
     more levels of detail.

BUGS
     Only the first realm in the kdc.conf file is registered via rendezvous.
