NTPTRACE(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              NTPTRACE(8)

NAME
     ntptrace -- trace a chain of NTP servers back to the primary source

SYNOPSIS
     ntptrace [-vdn] [-r retries] [-t timeout] [server]

DESCRIPTION
     The ntptrace utility determines where a given Network Time Protocol (NTP)
     server gets its time from, and follows the chain of NTP servers back to
     their master time source.  If given no arguments, it starts with
     ``localhost''.

     Here is an example of the output from ntptrace:

     % ntptrace
     localhost: stratum 4, offset 0.0019529, synch distance 0.144135
     server2ozo.com: stratum 2, offset 0.0124263, synch distance 0.115784
     usndh.edu: stratum 1, offset 0.0019298, synch distance 0.011993, refid 'WWVB'

     On each line, the fields are (left to right): the host name, the host
     stratum, the time offset between that host and the local host (as mea-
     sured by ntptrace; this is why it is not always zero for ``localhost''),
     the host synchronization distance, and (only for stratum-1 servers) the
     reference clock ID.  All times are given in seconds.  Note that the stra-
     tum is the server hop count to the primary source, while the synchroniza-
     tion distance is the estimated error relative to the primary source.
     These terms are precisely defined in RFC 1305.

     The following options are available:

     -d      Turn on some debugging output.

     -n      Turn off the printing of host names; instead, host IP addresses
             are given.  This may be necessary if a nameserver is down.

     -r retries
             Set the number of retransmission attempts for each host; the
             default is 5.

     -t timeout
             Set the retransmission timeout (in seconds); the default is 2.

     -v      Print verbose information about the NTP servers.

BUGS
     This program makes no attempt to improve accuracy by doing multiple sam-
     ples.
