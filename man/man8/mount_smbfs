MOUNT_SMBFS(8)            BSD System Manager's Manual           MOUNT_SMBFS(8)

NAME
     mount_smbfs -- mount a shared resource from an SMB file server

SYNOPSIS
     mount_smbfs [-N] [-o options] [-d mode] [-f mode] [-h]
                 //[domain;][user[:password]@]server[/share] path

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_smbfs command mounts a share from a remote server using
     SMB/CIFS protocol.

     The options are as follows:

     -N      Do not ask for a password.  At run time, mount_smbfs reads the
             ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf file for additional configuration
             parameters and a password.  If no password is found, mount_smbfs
             prompts for it.

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option fol-
             lowed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. Additional
             options supported by the mount_smbfs are as follows:

             nobrowse
                     Indicate to the Carbon subsystem that this volume is not
                     to be displayed to the user.

             automounted
                     Set flags on the mountpoint to indicate that the volume
                     has been mounted by the automounter.

             streams
                     Use NTFS Streams if supported by the server.

             soft    Make the mount soft.  Fail file system calls after a num-
                     ber of seconds.

     -f mode, -d mode
             Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and directo-
             ries.  The values must be specified as octal numbers.  Default
             value for the file mode is taken from mount point, default value
             for the directory mode adds execute permission where the file
             mode gives read permission.

             Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by
             SMB server.

     -h      Prints a help message, much like the SYNOPSIS above.

     //[domain;][user[password]@] server[/share]
             The mount_smbfs command will use server as the NetBIOS name of
             remote computer, user as the remote user name and share as the
             resource name on a remote server.  Domain and/or password may be
             specified here.  If user is omitted the logged in user id will be
             used.  Omitting share is an error when mount_smbfs is run from
             the command line, otherwise a browsing dialogue is presented.

     path    Path to mount point.

FILES
     nsmb.conf  Keeps static parameters for connections and other information.
                See man nsmb.conf for details.

EXAMPLES
     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from
     the SMB server myserver:

           mkdir /smb/public
           mount -t smbfs //username:userpass@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public

     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from
     the SMB server myserver as guest:

           mkdir /smb/public
           mount -t smbfs //guest:@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public
