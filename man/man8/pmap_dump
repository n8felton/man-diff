NAME
     pmap_dump -- print a list of all registered RPC programs

SYNOPSIS
     pmap_dump

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_dump command can be used to restart a running portmapper or to
     print a list of all registered RPC programs on the local host. If you
     want to use the program to restart the portmapper you have to redirect
     the output of pmap_dump to a file. After this you can restart the
     portmapper and restore the list of the registered RPC programs by feeding
     the output of pmap_dump to the command.
