NAME
       cupsdisable, cupsenable - stop/start printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       cupsdisable [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -c ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -r rea-
       son ] destination(s)
       cupsenable [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -c ] [ -h server[:port]  ]  destina-
       tion(s)

DESCRIPTION
       cupsenable starts the named printers or classes.

       cupsdisable stops the named printers or classes.  The following options
       may be used:

       -E
            Forces encryption of the connection to the server.

       -U username
            Uses the specified username when connecting to the server.

       -c
            Cancels all jobs on the named destination.

       -h server[:port]
            Uses the specified server and port.

       -r "reason"
            Sets the message associated with the stopped state. If  no  reason
            is specified then the message is set to "Reason Unknown".

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to con-
       tain any printable character except SPACE, TAB,  "/",  or  "#".   Also,
       printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The  System  V  versions of these commands are disable and enable. They
       have been renamed to avoid conflicts with the bash(1) build-in  command
       of the same name.

       The  CUPS versions of disable and enable may ask the user for an access
       password depending on the printing system configuration.  This  differs
       from the System V versions which require the root user to execute these
       commands.
