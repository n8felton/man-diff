IDMAP_NSS(8)                                                      IDMAP_NSS(8)



NAME
       idmap_nss - Samba's idmap_nss Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The  idmap_nss  plugin provides a means to map Unix users and groups to
       Windows accounts and  obseletes  the  "winbind  trusted  domains  only"
       smb.conf  option. This provides a simple means of ensuring that the SID
       for a Unix user named jsmith is reported as the one assigned to DOMAIN-
       jsmith  which  is  necessary  for  reporting ACLs on files and printers
       stored on a Samba member server.

EXAMPLES
       This example shows how to use idmap_nss to check the local accounts for
       its  own  domain  while  using  allocation  to  create new mappings for
       trusted domains


            [global]
                idmap domains = SAMBA TRUSTEDDOMAINS

                idmap config SAMBA:backend  = nss
                idmap config SAMBA:readonly = yes

                idmap config TRUSTEDDOMAINS:default = yes
                idmap config TRUSTEDDOMAINS:backend = tdb
                idmap config TRUSTEDDOMAINS:range   = 10000 - 50000

                idmap alloc backend      = tdb
                idmap alloc config:range = 10000 - 50000


AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were  created  by
       Andrew  Tridgell.  Samba  is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
