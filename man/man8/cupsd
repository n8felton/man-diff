NAME
       cupsd - common unix printing system daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cupsd [ -c config-file ] [ -f ] [ -F ] [ -h ] [ -l ]

DESCRIPTION
       cupsd  is  the scheduler for the Common UNIX Printing System. It imple-
       ments a printing system based upon the Internet Printing Protocol, ver-
       sion  1.1.   If  no  options are specified on the command-line then the
       default configuration file /private/etc/cups/cupsd.conf will be used.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
            Uses the named configuration file.

       -f
            Run cupsd in the foreground; the default is to run  in  the  back-
            ground as a "daemon".

       -F
            Run  cupsd  in the foreground but detach the process from the con-
            trolling terminal and current directory. This is useful  for  run-
            ning cupsd from init(8).

       -h
            Shows the program usage.

       -l
            This option is passed to cupsd when it is run from launchd(8).

COMPATIBILITY
       cupsd implements all of the required IPP/1.1 attributes and operations.
       It also implements several CUPS-specific administration operations.
