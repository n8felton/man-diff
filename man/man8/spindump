NAME
     spindump -- hang reporting tool

SYNOPSIS
     spindump

DESCRIPTION
     spindump is a tool used by various system components to create hang
     reports and notify the user of application hangs. Most users should not
     run spindump manually, but it can be invoked by the root user with argu-
     ments similar to those for sample(1) for debugging purposes.

     Hang reports are stored at:

     /Library/Logs/HangReporter/<<application-name>>/<<hang-date>>.hang

     For normal application crashes spindump will display a dialog to alert
     the console user to the crash and offer the choice to view more details
     about the crash and/or report the crash to Apple.
