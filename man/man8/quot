NAME
     quot -- display total block usage per user for a file system

SYNOPSIS
     quot [-ncf] [filesystem ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The quot command displays the total count of blocks owned by a user for
     the filesystem filesystem.  If the filesystem option filesystem is not
     specified, the file systems listed in /etc/fstab are used.  The following
     options are available:

     -c      Display information on file size and block usage. The file sizes
             are listed in the first column, the second column contains a
             count of how many files of that size were found and the third
             column lists the cumulative block usage for the displayed size
             and all smaller files.

     -f      For each user, the number of files (inodes) owned is displayed in
             addition to the block usage.

     -n      A list sorted by block usage is displayed.  This is the result of
             quot executing the following command:

                   ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot -n filesystem
