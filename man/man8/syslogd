SYSLOGD(8)                BSD System Manager's Manual               SYSLOGD(8)

NAME
     syslogd -- Apple System Log server

SYNOPSIS
     syslogd [-d] [-D] [-m mark_interval] [-c log_cutoff] [-l lib_path]
             [-db_max size] [-utmp_ttl time] [-fs_ttl time] [-dup_delay time]
             [-module_name {0|1}]

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogd server receives and processes log messages.  Several modules
     receive input messages through various channels, including UNIX domain
     sockets associated with the syslog(3), asl(3), and kernel printf APIs,
     and optionally on a UDP socket from network clients.

     The Apple System Log facility comprises the asl(3) API, a new syslogd
     server, the syslog(1) command-line utility, and a data store file man-
     ager, aslmanager(8).  The system supports structured and extensible mes-
     sages, permitting advanced message browsing and management through search
     APIs and other components of the Apple system log facility.

     Log messages are retained in a data store, subject to automatic archival,
     and input filtering as described below, to simplify the task of locating
     log messages and to facilitate browsing and searching.  The data store is
     intended to become a replacement for the numerous log files that are cur-
     rently found in various locations on the system.  Those files will be
     phased out in future versions of Mac OS.

     The following options are recognized:

     -d         Run syslogd in debugging mode.  The server stays attached to
                the controlling terminal and prints debugging messages.

     -D         Start as a daemon.  This option forces syslogd to fork and
                have the child process become a daemon.  Since syslogd is
                started by launchd, this is not normally required.

     -m         Set the number of minutes between ``mark'' messages.  Mark
                messages are normally disabled.  If -m is specified with no
                arguments, mark messages will be written every 20 minutes.
                The ``mark'' facility is disabled if the setting is zero min-
                utes.

     -c         Sets a cutoff filter for log priorities for messages to be
                retained in the log message data store.  The value of
                log_cutoff must be between 0 and 7, corresponding to log pri-
                orities LOG_EMERG or ASL_LEVEL_EMERG and LOG_DEBUG or
                ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG as defined in the syslog(3) and asl(3) header
                files.  Received messages with a priority or level value
                greater than the cutoff will not be saved in the data store.
                The default filter will retain messages in the range 0 (Emer-
                gency) to 5 (Notice) inclusive.

                Note that a this filter value may be adjusted while syslogd is
                running using the syslog command-line utility.  See the
                syslog(1) manual.  The filter may be adjusted using the ``-c''
                option, e.g.

                     sudo syslog -c syslogd -d

                will set the filter to retain messages in the range 0 (Emer-
                gency) to 7 (Debug).

     -l         Specifies an alternate path for loading plug-in modules.  By
                default, syslogd checks for plug-in modules in the directory
                /usr/lib/asl.

     -db_max    Sets the size limit in bytes for files in the data store.  The
                default value for -db_max is 25600000 bytes.  Files are closed
                upon reaching the maximum size, and a new file is opened for
                subsequent messages.

     -utmp_ttl  Sets the time-to-live in seconds for messages used by the
                utmp, wtmp, and lastlog subsystems.  The default is 31622400
                seconds (approximately 1 year).  Note that if archival is
                enabled (see the aslmanager(8) manual), these messages will be
                copied to an archive after the regular time-to-live interval,
                but will persist in the data store until their own expiry
                time.

     -fs_ttl    Sets the time-to-live in seconds for filesystem error messages
                generated by the kernel.  The default is 31622400 seconds
                (approximately 1 year).  As in the case of -utmp_ttl, if
                archival is enabled, these messages will be copied to an ar-
                chive after the regular time-to-live interval but will persist
                in the data store until their own expiry time.

     -dup_delay
                Sets the time to delay for coalescing duplicate message in log
                files.  If a process logs multiple messages with the same
                text, syslogd will wait for the specified period of time to
                coalesce duplicates.  If identical messages arrive during this
                interval, syslogd will print a message of the form:

                     May 7 12:34:56: --- last message repeated 17 times ---

                The default delay time is 30 seconds.  Setting the value to 0
                disables the coalescing mechanism.

     The remaining options of the form -module_name {0|1} may be used to dis-
     able (0) or enable (1) the action of several of internal modules.

     -asl_in      The ``asl_in'' module receives log messages on the UNIX
                  domain socket associated with the asl(3) API.  The module
                  may be disabled using -asl_in 0.  The module is normally
                  enabled.

     -asl_action  The ``asl_action'' module examines the stream of received
                  log messages and acts upon them according to the rules spec-
                  ified in the file /etc/asl.conf.  See asl.conf(5) for
                  details.

     -klog_in     The ``klog_in'' module receives log messages on the UNIX
                  domain socket associated with the kernel logging API.  The
                  module may be disabled using -klog_in 0.  The module is nor-
                  mally enabled.

     -bsd_in      The ``bsd_in'' module receives log messages on the UNIX
                  domain socket associated with the syslog(3) API.  The module
                  may be disabled using -bsd_in 0.  The module is normally
                  enabled.

     -bsd_out     The ``bsd_out'' module examines the stream of received log
                  messages and acts upon them according to the rules specified
                  in the file /etc/syslog.conf.  See syslog.conf(5) for
                  details.  This module exists for backward compatibility with
                  previous syslogd implementations.  Apple encourages use of
                  the syslog(1) and asl(3) search APIs over the use of the log
                  files that are specified in the /etc/syslog.conf file.
                  Future versions of Mac OS will move functions that are cur-
                  rently handled by the ``bsd_out'' module to the
                  ``asl_action'' module.

     -udp_in      The ``udp_in'' module receives log messages on the UDP
                  socket associated with the Internet syslog message protocol.

                  This module is normally enabled, but is inactive.  The
                  actual UDP sockets are managed by launched, and configured
                  in the syslogd configuration file /System/Library/LaunchDae-
                  mons/com.apple.syslogd.plist.  In the default configuration,
                  launchd does not open any sockets for the ``syslog'' UDP
                  service, so no sockets are provided to the ``udp_in'' mod-
                  ule.  If no sockets are provided, the module remains inac-
                  tive.

                  The module may be specifically disabled using the -udp_in 0
                  option.

     syslogd reinitializes in response to a HUP signal.

MESSAGE EXPIRY AND ARCHIVAL
     syslogd periodically invokes the aslmanager utility, which manages files
     in the ASL data store.  Files are removed or optionally copied to an
     archival directory after a (default) 2 day time-to-live.  See the
     aslmanager(8) manual for details.  syslogd invokes aslmanager shortly
     after it starts up, at midnight local time if it is running, and any time
     that a data store file reaches the -db_max size limit.

DATA STORE SECURITY
     Messages saved in the ASL message store are written to files in
     /var/log/asl.  The message files are given read access controls corre-
     sponding to the read UID and GID specified in the messages themselves.
     Read access UID and GID settings may be attached to messages using the
     asl(3) library by setting a value for the "ReadUID" and/or "ReadGID" mes-
     sage keys.  The file permissions prevent access-controlled messages from
     being read by unauthorized users.

     Although clients are generally free to use any value for the "Facility"
     message key, only processes running with UID 0 may log messages with a
     facility value of "com.apple.system", or with a value that has
     "com.apple.system" as a prefix.  Messages logged by non UID 0 processes
     that use "com.apple.system" as a facility value or prefix will be saved
     with the facility value "user".
