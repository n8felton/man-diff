DESCRIPTION
     This tool allows command-line configuration of the Active Directory Plug-
     in.  dsconfigad has the same functionality for configuring the Active
     Directory plugin as the Directory Access application.  It requires
     "admin" privileges to the local workstation and to the Directory to make
     changes.

     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -h       Lists the options for calling dsconfigad

     -show    Shows the current configuration of the Active Directory Plugin

     -f       Force the process (i.e., join the existing account or remove the
              binding)

     -a computerid
              Add "computerid" to the specified Domain

     -r       Remove this computer from the current Domain

     -status  Print status information while adding computer to domain.

     -u username
              Username of a Network account that has administrative privileges
              to add/remove this computer to/from the specified Domain

     -p password
              Password to use in conjunction with the specified username.  If
              this is not specified, you will be prompted for entry.

     -lu username
              Username of a local account that has administrative privileges
              to this computer

     -lp password
              Password to use in conjunction with the specified local user-
              name.  If this is not specified, you will be prompted for entry.

     -domain fqdn
              The fully-qualified DNS name of the Domain to be used when
              adding the computer to the Directory (e.g.,
              domain.ads.demo.com).

     -ou dn   The LDAP DN of the container to use for adding the computer.  If
              this is not specified, it will default to the container
              "CN=Computers" within the domain that was specified (e.g.,
              "CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=ads,DC=demo,DC=com"

     -mobile enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin will enable mobile
              account support for offline logon (disabled by default).  This
              flag is a hint.  If the appopriate Workgroup Management settings
              exist for a user, this will not override, as directory settings
              for the user take precendence.

     -mobileconfirm enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin will warn the user when
              a mobile account is going to be created.  This flag is a hint as
              discussed in -mobile

     -localhome enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin forces all home directo-
              ries to be local to the computer (i.e., /Users/username)
              (enabled by default).

     -useuncpath enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin uses the UNC specified
              in the Active Directory when mounting the network home.  If this
              is disabled, the plugin will look for Apple schema extensions to
              mount the home directory.

     -protocol afp | smb
              This flag determines how a home directory is mounted on the
              desktop.  By default SMB is used, but AFP can be used for use
              with Mac OS X Server or 3rd Party AFP solutions on Windows
              Servers (previously known as mountstyle)

     -shell value
              Use the specified shell (e.g., "/bin/bash") if a shell attribute
              does not exist in the directory for the user logging into this
              computer.  Use a shell value of "none" to disable use of a
              default shell, preserving values that are only specified in the
              directory.

     -uid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the UID of the user.
              By default, a UID is generated from the Active Directory GUID.

     -nouid   Turn off any previously mapped attribute and generate the UID
              from the Active Directory GUID.

     -gid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the GID of the user.
              By default, a GID is derived from the primaryGroupID of the user
              (typically Domain Users).

     -nogid   Turn off any previously mapped attribute and use the GID from
              the directory.

     -ggid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the GID of the
              group.  By default, a group GID is generated from the Active
              Directory GUID of the group.

     -noggid  Turn off any previously mapped attribute and generate the group
              GID from the Active Directory GUID.

     -preferred server
              Use the specified server for all Directory lookups and authenti-
              cations.  If the server is no longer available, it will fail-
              over to other servers.

     -nopreferred
              Turn off any previously specified server and default to dynamic
              server discovery.

     -groups group1,group2,...
              Use the listed groups to determine who has local administrative
              privileges on this computer.  Groups can be specified by domain
              to ensure security is not compromised, e.g., "domain
              admins@domain.ads.demo.com"

     -nogroups
              Disable use of the current groups for determining administrative
              privileges on this computer.

     -alldomains enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin allows authentication
              from any domain in the forest.  When this is enabled, individual
              domains will not be visible, only "All Domains". If it is dis-
              abled, you will have the ability to select the specific domains
              that can authenticate to this computer. Enabled by default.

     -staticmap attribute-type attribute-value
              Enable static mapping of an attribute-type to a specific
              attribute-value for User records.  Do not static map values such
              as UID, RecordName and GeneratedUID as unexpected behavior will
              occur.  This is for use in other attributes that are not typi-
              cally searched.  Attribute types are Directory Service types
              (i.e., "dsAttrTypeStandard:State"), see DirectoryServiceAt-
              tributes(7).

     -packetsign allow | disable | require
              By default packet signing is allowed but not required, but can
              be required or disabled (for example if debugging a problem).
              This ensures that the data to/from the server is not tampered
              with by another computer before received it is received.

     -packetencrypt allow | disable | require
              By default packet encryption is allowed but not required, but
              can be required or disabled (for example if debugging a prob-
              lem).  This ensures that the data to/from the server is
              encrypted and signed guaranteeing the content was not tampered
              with and cannot be seen by other computers on the network.

     -passinterval value
              Set how often the computer trust account password should be
              changed (default 14).

     -namespace forest | domain
              Sets the primary account username naming convention.  By default
              it is set to "domain" naming which assumes no conflicting user
              accounts across all domains.  If your Active Directory forest
              has conflicts setting this to "forest" will prefix all usernames
              with "DOMAIN\" to ensure unique naming between domains (e.g.,
              "ADDOMAIN\user1").  Warning:  this will change the primary name
              of the user for all logins.  Changing this setting on an exist-
              ing system will cause any existing homes to be unused on the
              local machine.

     -enableSSO
              (Server Only) When using MacOS X Server with Active Directory,
              this enables SSO for all supported services.

EXAMPLES
     Adding a computer to a Directory:

     dsconfigad -a ThisComputer -u "administrator" -ou
     "CN=Computers,OU=Engineering,DC=ads,DC=demo,DC=com" -domain
     domain.ads.apple.com

     Giving a set of groups administrative access to the local computer:

     dsconfigad -groups "DOMAIN\domain admins,FOREST\enterprise
     admins,DOMAIN\desktop techs"
