bootparamd(8)             BSD System Manager's Manual            bootparamd(8)

NAME
     bootparamd -- boot parameter server

SYNOPSIS
     bootparamd [-d] [-r router]

DESCRIPTION
     bootparamd provides configuration parameters for clients using the boot-
     params RPC protocol.  The server is not started by default on Mac OS X
     systems, nor is it used by Mac OS X clients.

     When invoked with the -d option, bootparamd runs in debug mode.  It
     remains attached to the controlling terminal and prints a log of its
     activity.

     The -r router option may be used to set the router returned in WHOAMI
     replies.  The router argument may be a name or a dotted-quad IP address.
