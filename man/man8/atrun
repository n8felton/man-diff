ATRUN(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 ATRUN(8)

NAME
     atrun -- run jobs queued for later execution

SYOPSIS
     atrun

DESCRIPTION
     The atrun utility runs commands queued by at(1).  It is usually invoked
     by crond(8) every ten minutes.

FILES
     /var/at/jobs      Directory containing job files
     /var/at/spool     Directory containing output spool files
     /var/at/lockfile  Job-creation lock file.

SEE ALSO
     at(1), crond(8)

BUGS
     The functionality of atrun should arguably be merged into crond(8).

CAVEATS
     Because the default configuration causes atrun to be invoked every ten
     minutes, commands queued by at(1) may end up being executed up to nine
     minutes later than would be otherwise expected.
