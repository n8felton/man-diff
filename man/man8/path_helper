path_helper(8)            BSD System Manager's Manual           path_helper(8)

NAME
     path_helper -- helper for constructing PATH environment variable

SYNOPSIS
     path_helper [-c | -s]

DESCRIPTION
     The path_helper utility reads the contents of the files in the directo-
     ries /etc/paths.d and /etc/manpaths.d and appends their contents to the
     PATH and MANPATH environment variables respectively.

     Files in these directories should contain one path element per line.

     Prior to reading these directories, default PATH and MANPATH values are
     obtained from the files /etc/paths and /etc/manpaths respectively.

     Options:

     -c      Generate C-shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL ends with "csh".

     -s      Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL does not end with "csh".

NOTE
     The path_helper utility should not be invoked directly.  It is intended
     only for use by the shell profile.
