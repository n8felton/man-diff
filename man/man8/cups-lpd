NAME
       cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to lpd clients

SYNOPSIS
       cups-lpd [ -n ] [ -o option=value ]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-lpd  is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that sup-
       ports legacy client systems that use the LPD  protocol.  cups-lpd  does
       not  act  as a standalone network daemon but instead operates using the
       Internet "super-server" inetd(8) or xinetd(8). If you are using  inetd,
       add  the  following  line to the inetd.conf file to enable the cups-lpd
       mini-server:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/libexec/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd \
               -o document-format=application/octet-stream


       Note: If you are using Solaris 10 or higher, you must  run  the  inetd-
       conv(1m) program to register the changes to the inetd.conf file.

       If  you  are  using  the  newer  xinetd(8)  daemon, create a file named
       /etc/xinetd.d/cups containing the following lines:

           service printer
           {
               socket_type = stream
               protocol = tcp
               wait = no
               user = lp
            group = sys
            passenv =
               server = /usr/libexec/cups/daemon/cups-lpd
            server_args = -o document-format=application/octet-stream
           }

OPTIONS
       -n
            Disables reverse address lookups; normally cups-lpd  will  try  to
            discover the hostname of the client via a reverse DNS lookup.

       -o name=value
            Inserts  options  for all print queues. Most often this is used to
            disable the "l" filter so that remote print jobs are  filtered  as
            needed  for printing; the examples in the previous section set the
            "document-format"  option  to   "application/octet-stream"   which
            forces autodetection of the print file format.

PERFORMANCE
       cups-lpd performs well with small numbers of clients and printers. How-
       ever, since a new process is created for each connection and since each
       process  must  query the printing system before each job submission, it
       does not scale to larger configurations. We highly recommend that large
       configurations use the native IPP support provided by CUPS instead.

SECURITY
       cups-lpd  currently  does  not  perform any access control based on the
       settings in cupsd.conf(5) or in  the  hosts.allow(5)  or  hosts.deny(5)
       files  used by TCP wrappers. Therefore, running cups-lpd on your server
       will allow any computer on your network (and perhaps the entire  Inter-
       net) to print to your server.

       While  xinetd  has  built-in access control support, you should use the
       TCP wrappers package with inetd to limit access to only those computers
       that should be able to print through your server.

       cups-lpd is not enabled by the standard CUPS distribution.  Please con-
       sult with your operating system  vendor  to  determine  whether  it  is
       enabled on your system.

COMPATIBILITY
       cups-lpd  does  not enforce the restricted source port number specified
       in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports does not prevent users from sub-
       mitting  print  jobs.  While  this  behavior is different than standard
       Berkeley LPD implementations, it should not affect normal client opera-
       tions.

       The output of the status requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping between LPD
       and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD implementations stray from this defi-
       nition, remote status reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.
