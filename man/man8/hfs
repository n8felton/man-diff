DESCRIPTION
     The hfs.util command supports the mounting, probing, and unmounting of
     HFS file systems.

     Options:
           -a          Adopt permissions for the HFS file system at device
           -I          Print out status information about the journal on the
                       HFS file system at mountpoint
           -J [size]   Enable journaling on the HFS file system mounted on
                       mountpoint.  An optional size may be specified (e.g.
                       32M for a 32 megabyte journal).
           -k          Get the UUID key for the HFS file system at device
           -m          Mount the HFS file system located on device onto
                       mountpoint with the flags mountflag1 mountflag2
                       mountflag3 mountflag4
           -M          Force mount the HFS file system located on device onto
                       mountpoint with the flags mountflag1 mountflag2
                       mountflag3 mountflag4.  This is a deprecated option.
           -p          Probe the device for an HFS file system using the flags
                       mountflag1 mountflag2 mountflag3 mountflag4
           -s          Set the UUID key (generates a new UUID value) for the
                       HFS file system at device
           -u          Unmount the HFS file system located at device
           -U          Disable journaling on the HFS file system mounted on
                       mountpoint

     The mountflags referenced above are either:
           o   removable or fixed
           o   readonly or writeable
           o   suid or nosuid
           o   dev or nodev
