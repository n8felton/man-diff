YPXFR(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 YPXFR(8)

NAME
     ypxfr -- get a YP map from YP server

SYNOPSIS
     ypxfr [-bcf] [-d domain] [-h host] [-s domain] [-C tid prog ipadd port]
           mapname

DESCRIPTION
     ypxfr is the utiliy in YP that transfers maps to the local host.

     Since the YP master transfers a map when it has changed, an YP slave
     should check for missed maps regulary. This can be done via an entry in
     crontab(5).  The scripts ypxfr_1perhour, ypxfr_2perday and ypxfr_1perday
     could be used for that.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Preserve the entry in the database informing a YP server to use
             DNS to get information about unknown hosts. This option will only
             have effect on the two maps hosts.byname and hosts.byaddr.

     -c      Don't send a "Clear current map" to local ypserv process. Useful
             if ypserv isn't running localy to avoid timeout message.

     -f      Force map transfer, even if version of master is older than local
             copy.

     -d domain
             Don't use default domain, use the specifiyed domain.

     -h host
             Get map from host insteed of the maps master host.

     -s domain
             Specify a source domain other than the target domain.

     -C tid prog ipadd port
             This option is only used by ypserv. This is to open communication
             with an yppush on another host.
