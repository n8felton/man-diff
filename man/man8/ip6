ip6(8)                    BSD System Manager's Manual                   ip6(8)

NAME
     ip6 -- Enable or disable IPv6 on active interfaces

SYNOPSIS
     ip6 [-ax] [-ud -interface]

DESCRIPTION
     ip6 can be used to start up or shut down IPv6 on active interfaces.  When
     IPv6 is enabled on an interface the protocol is attached to the inter-
     face, at which point the default settings in the kernel allow it to
     acquire a link-local address and accept router advertisements.  Disabling
     detaches the protocol from the interface.

     Possible options are:

     -a   Start IPv6 on all interfaces.

     -x   Stop IPv6 on all interfaces.

     -u -[interface]
          Start IPv6 on interface.

     -d -[interface]
          Stop IPv6 on interface.

REQUIREMENTS
     You need support for IPv6 in your kernel. This is provided beginning with
     Darwin Kernel Version 6.0.

CONFIGURATION
     The default IPv6 configuration for an interface assigns a link-local
     address to it and sets the interface to receive router advertisements.
     No further configuration is necessary for basic functionality.  However,
     various settings can be modified by using sysctl.  Pp
