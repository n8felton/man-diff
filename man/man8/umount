UMOUNT(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                UMOUNT(8)

NAME
     umount -- unmount filesystems

SYNOPSIS
     umount [-fv] special | node
     umount -a | -A [-fv] [-h host] [-t type]

DESCRIPTION
     The umount command calls the unmount(2) system call to remove a special
     device or the remote node (rhost:path) from the filesystem tree at the
     point node.  If either special or node are not provided, the appropriate
     information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      All the filesystems described in fstab(5) are unmounted.

     -A      All the currently mounted filesystems except the root are
             unmounted.

     -f      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
             continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
             accesses are attempted.  The root filesystem cannot be forcibly
             unmounted.

     -h host
             Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be
             unmounted.  This option is implies the -A option and, unless oth-
             erwise specified with the -t option, will only unmount NFS
             filesystems.

     -t type
             Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-
             tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified
             in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
             prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which
             action should not be taken.  For example, the umount command:

                   umount -a -t nfs,hfs

             umounts all filesystems of the type NFS and HFS.

     -v      Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem
             is unmounted.

FILES
     /etc/fstab  filesystem table
