NAME
       lpc - line printer control program

SYNOPSIS
       lpc [ command [ parameter(s) ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpc  provides limited control over printer and class queues provided by
       CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of queues.

       If no command is specified on the  command-line,  lpc  will  display  a
       prompt and accept commands from the standard input.

COMMANDS
       The  lpc  program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the Berkeley
       lpc program of the same name:

       exit
            Exits the command interpreter.

       help [command]

       ? [command]
            Displays a short help message.

       quit
            Exits the command interpreter.

       status [queue]
            Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.

LIMITATIONS
       Since lpc is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is  impos-
       sible to use lpc to configure printer or class queues provided by CUPS.
       To configure printer or class queues you must use the  lpadmin(8)  com-
       mand or another CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CUPS version of lpc does not implement all of the standard Berkeley
       or LPRng commands.
