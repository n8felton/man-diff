NAME
       vfs_full_audit - record Samba VFS operations in the system log

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = full_audit

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The vfs_full_audit VFS module records selected client operations to the
       system log using syslog(3).

       vfs_full_audit is able to record the complete set of Samba  VFS  opera-
       tions:

       In  addition to these operations, vfs_full_audit recognizes the special
       operation names "all" and "none ", which refer to all  the  VFS  opera-
       tions and none of the VFS operations respectively.

       vfs_full_audit  records operations in fixed format consisting of fields
       separated by '|' characters. The format is:


                 smbd_audit: PREFIX|OPERATION|RESULT|FILE


       The record fields are:

       o  PREFIX - the result of the full_audit:prefix string  after  variable
          substitutions

       o  OPERATION - the name of the VFS operation

       o  RESULT - whether the operation succeeded or failed

       o  FILE - the name of the file or directory the operation was performed
          on

       This module is stackable.

OPTIONS
       vfs_full_audit:prefix = STRING
          Prepend audit messages with STRING. STRING is processed for standard
          substitution  variables listed in smb.conf(5). The default prefix is
          "%u|%I".

       vfs_full_audit:success = LIST
          LIST is a list of VFS operations that should  be  recorded  if  they
          succeed. Operations are specified using the names listed above.

       vfs_full_audit:failure = LIST
          LIST  is  a  list  of VFS operations that should be recorded if they
          failed. Operations are specified using the names listed above.

       full_audit:facility = FACILITY
          Log messages to the named syslog(3) facility.

       full_audit:priority = PRIORITY
          Log messages with the named syslog(3) priority.

EXAMPLES
       Log file and directory open operations on the [records] share using the
       LOCAL7  facility  and  ALERT  priority,  including  the username and IP
       address:


               [records]
            path = /data/records
            vfs objects = full_audit
            full_audit:prefix = %u|%I
            full_audit:success = open opendir
            full_audit:failure = all
            full_audit:facility = LOCAL7
            full_audit:priority = ALERT
