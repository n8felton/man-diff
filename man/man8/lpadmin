NAME
       lpadmin - configure cups printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destination
       lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -p printer option(s)
       lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination

DESCRIPTION
       lpadmin configures printer and class queues provided by  CUPS.  It  can
       also be used to set the server default printer or class.

       When  specified  before the -d, -p, or -x options, the -E option forces
       encryption when connecting to the server.

       The first form of the command (-d) sets the default printer or class to
       destination.   Subsequent  print jobs submitted via the lp(1) or lpr(1)
       commands will use this destination unless the user specifies  otherwise
       with the lpoptions(1) command.

       The  second form of the command (-p) configures the named printer.  The
       additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command (-x) deletes the printer or class  desti-
       nation.  Any  jobs that are pending for the destination will be removed
       and any job that is currently printed will be aborted.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized when configuring a printer queue:

       -c class
            Adds the named printer to class.  If class does not  exist  it  is
            created automatically.

       -i interface
            Sets  a  System  V  style  interface  script for the printer. This
            option cannot be specified with the -P option (PPD  file)  and  is
            intended for providing support for legacy printer drivers.

       -m model
            Sets  a  standard  System  V interface script or PPD file from the
            model directory.

       -o job-k-limit=value
            Sets the kilobyte limit for per-user quotas. The value is an inte-
            ger number of kilobytes; one kilobyte is 1024 bytes.

       -o job-page-limit=value
            Sets  the page limit for per-user quotas. The value is the integer
            number of pages  that  can  be  printed;  double-sided  pages  are
            counted as two pages.

       -o job-quota-period=value
            Sets  the  accounting  period for per-user quotas. The value is an
            integer number of seconds; 86,400 seconds are in one day.

       -o job-sheets-default=banner

       -o job-sheets-default=banner,banner
            Sets the default banner page(s) to use for print jobs.

       -o name=value
            Sets a PPD option for the printer. PPD options can be listed using
            the -l option with the lpoptions(1) command.

       -o name-default=value
            Sets  a default server-side option for the printer. Any print-time
            option can be defaulted,  e.g.  "-o  cpi-default=17"  to  set  the
            default "cpi" option value to 17.

       -o port-monitor=name
            Sets  the  binary  communications  program  to  use when printing,
            "none", "bcp", or "tbcp". The default program is "none". The spec-
            ified port monitor must be listed in the printer's PPD file.

       -o printer-error-policy=name
            Sets  the  error  policy  to  be  used when the printer backend is
            unable to send the job to the printer. The name  must  be  one  of
            "abort-job", "retry-job" or "stop-printer". The default error pol-
            icy is "stop-printer".

       -o printer-is-shared=true/false
            Sets the  printer  to  shared/published  or  unshared/unpublished.
            Shared/published  printers  are publically announced by the server
            on the LAN based on  the  browsing  configuration  in  cupsd.conf,
            while unshared/unpublished printers are not announced. The default
            value is "true".

       -o printer-op-policy=name
            Sets the IPP operation policy associated  with  the  printer.  The
            name  must  be defined in the cupsd.conf in a Policy section.  The
            default operation policy is "default".

       -r class
            Removes the named printer from  class.   If  the  resulting  class
            becomes empty it is removed.

       -u allow:user,user,@group

       -u deny:user,user,@group

       -u allow:all

       -u deny:none
            Sets  user-level  access control on a printer. Names starting with
            "@" are interpreted as UNIX groups.  The  latter  two  forms  turn
            user-level access control off.

       -v "device-uri"
            Sets the device-uri attribute of the printer queue.  If device-uri
            is  a  filename  it  is  automatically  converted  to   the   form
            file:///file/name. Use the lpinfo(8) command to get a list of sup-
            ported device URIs and schemes.

       -D "info"
            Provides a textual description of the printer.

       -E
            Enables the printer and accepts jobs; this is the same as  running
            the accept(8) and cupsenable(8) programs on the printer.

       -L "location"
            Provides a textual location of the printer.

       -P ppd-file
            Specifies  a  PostScript  Printer Description file to use with the
            printer. If specified, this option overrides the -i option (inter-
            face script).

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to con-
       tain any printable character except SPACE, TAB,  "/",  or  "#".   Also,
       printer and class names are not case-sensitive.  Finally, the CUPS ver-
       sion of lpadmin may ask the user for an access  password  depending  on
       the  printing system configuration. This differs from the System V ver-
       sion which requires the root user to execute this command.

LIMITATIONS
       The CUPS version of lpadmin does not support all of  the  System  V  or
       Solaris printing system configuration options.
