NAME
       smtp - Postfix SMTP+LMTP client

SYNOPSIS
       smtp [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix SMTP+LMTP client implements the SMTP and LMTP mail delivery
       protocols. It processes message delivery requests from the  queue  man-
       ager.  Each  request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain
       or host to deliver to, and recipient information.  This program expects
       to be run from the master(8) process manager.

       The  SMTP+LMTP  client  updates  the queue file and marks recipients as
       finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried
       again  at  a  later  time.  Delivery  status  reports  are  sent to the
       bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

       The SMTP+LMTP client looks up a list of mail  exchanger  addresses  for
       the  destination  host,  sorts  the list by preference, and connects to
       each listed address until it finds a server that responds.

       When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails  due  to  a
       recoverable  error  condition, the SMTP+LMTP client will try to deliver
       the mail to an alternate host.

       After a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved  to  the
       scache(8)  connection  cache  server,  so  that  it  may be used by any
       SMTP+LMTP client for a subsequent transaction.

       By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for  destinations
       that have a high volume of mail in the active queue. Connection caching
       can be enabled permanently for specific destinations.

SMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX
       SMTP destinations have the following form:

       domainname

       domainname:port
              Look up the mail exchangers for the specified domain,  and  con-
              nect to the specified port (default: smtp).

       [hostname]

       [hostname]:port
              Look  up  the  address(es) of the specified host, and connect to
              the specified port (default: smtp).

       [address]

       [address]:port
              Connect to the host at the specified address, and connect to the
              specified  port (default: smtp). An IPv6 address must be format-
              ted as [ipv6:address].

LMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX
       LMTP destinations have the following form:

       unix:pathname
              Connect to the local UNIX-domain server that  is  bound  to  the
              specified  pathname.  If  the process runs chrooted, an absolute
              pathname is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.

       inet:hostname

       inet:hostname:port

       inet:[address]

       inet:[address]:port
              Connect  to  the  specified  TCP  port on the specified local or
              remote host. If no  port  is  specified,  connect  to  the  port
              defined  as  lmtp  in services(4).  If no such service is found,
              the lmtp_tcp_port configuration parameter (default value of  24)
              will   be   used.    An   IPv6  address  must  be  formatted  as
              [ipv6:address].


SECURITY
       The SMTP+LMTP client is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
       or LMTP servers and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP+LMTP client
       can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

STANDARDS
       RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)
       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       RFC 1651 (SMTP service extensions)
       RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)
       RFC 1870 (Message Size Declaration)
       RFC 2033 (LMTP protocol)
       RFC 2034 (SMTP Enhanced Error Codes)
       RFC 2045 (MIME: Format of Internet Message Bodies)
       RFC 2046 (MIME: Media Types)
       RFC 2554 (AUTH command)
       RFC 2821 (SMTP protocol)
       RFC 2920 (SMTP Pipelining)
       RFC 3207 (STARTTLS command)
       RFC 3461 (SMTP DSN Extension)
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted  message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
       queue for further inspection.

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the  postmas-
       ter is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of other trouble.

BUGS
       SMTP  and LMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
       support for TLS object passivation and  re-activation  does  not  exist
       without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

       SMTP  and  LMTP  connection  caching  assumes that SASL credentials are
       valid for all destinations that map onto the same IP  address  and  TCP
       port.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Before  Postfix version 2.3, the LMTP client is a separate program that
       implements only a subset of  the  functionality  available  with  SMTP:
       there  is  no  support  for TLS, and connections are cached in-process,
       making it ineffective when the client is used for multiple domains.

       Most smtp_xxx configuration parameters have an lmtp_xxx "mirror" param-
       eter  for  the  equivalent  LMTP  feature. This document describes only
       those LMTP-related parameters that aren't simply "mirror" parameters.

       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically,  as  smtp(8)  processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"
       to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See  postconf(5)  for
       more details including examples.
