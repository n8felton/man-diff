SLAPINDEX(8C)                                                    SLAPINDEX(8C)



NAME
       slapindex - SLAPD index to LDIF utility

SYNOPSIS
       /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-110~17/Root/usr/sbin/slapindex [-v] [-c]
       [-g] [-q] [-d  level]  [-b  suffix]  [-n  dbnum]  [-f  slapd.conf]  [-F
       confdir]


DESCRIPTION
       Slapindex is used to regenerate slapd(8) indices based upon the current
       contents of a database.  It opens the given database determined by  the
       database number or suffix and updates the indices for all values of all
       attributes of all entries.  Databases configured as subordinate of this
       one are also re-indexed, unless -g is specified.

OPTIONS
       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -c     enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -q     enable quick (fewer integrity checks) mode. Performs no  consis-
              tency  checks when writing the database. Improves indexing time,
              however the database will most likely be unusable if any  errors
              or interruptions occur.

       -d level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified level.

       -b suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to generate
              output for.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction  with  the  -n
              option.

       -n dbnum
              Generate output for the dbnum-th database listed in the configu-
              ration file.  The -n cannot be used in conjunction with  the  -b
              option.

       -f slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F confdir
              specify  a  config  directory.  If both -f and -F are specified,
              the config file will be read and converted to  config  directory
              format  and  written  to  the  specified  directory.  If neither
              option is specified, an  attempt  to  read  the  default  config
              directory  will  be made before trying to use the default config
              file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config
              file is ignored.

LIMITATIONS
       Your  slapd(8) should not be running (at least, not in read-write mode)
       when you do this to ensure consistency of the database.

       This command provides ample opportunity for  the  user  to  obtain  and
       drink their favorite beverage.

EXAMPLES
       To reindex your SLAPD database, give the command:

            /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-110~17/Root/usr/sbin/slapindex
