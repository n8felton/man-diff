PAM_UNIX(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              PAM_UNIX(8)

NAME
     pam_unix -- UNIX PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_unix [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The UNIX authentication service module for PAM, pam_unix provides func-
     tionality for two PAM categories: authentication and account management.
     In terms of the module-type parameter, they are the ``auth'' and
     ``account'' features.  It also provides a null function for session man-
     agement.

   UNIX Authentication Module
     The UNIX authentication component provides functions to verify the iden-
     tity of a user (pam_sm_authenticate()), which obtains the relevant
     passwd(5) entry.  It prompts the user for a password and verifies that
     this is correct with crypt(3).

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug           syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     use_first_pass  If the authentication module is not the first in the
                     stack, and a previous module obtained the user's pass-
                     word, that password is used to authenticate the user.  If
                     this fails, the authentication module returns failure
                     without prompting the user for a password.  This option
                     has no effect if the authentication module is the first
                     in the stack, or if no previous modules obtained the
                     user's password.

     try_first_pass  This option is similar to the use_first_pass option,
                     except that if the previously obtained password fails,
                     the user is prompted for another password.

     auth_as_self    This option will require the user to authenticate them-
                     self as the user given by getlogin(2), not as the account
                     they are attempting to access.  This is primarily for
                     services like su(1), where the user's ability to retype
                     their own password might be deemed sufficient.

     nullok          If the password database has no password for the entity
                     being authenticated, then this option will forgo password
                     prompting, and silently allow authentication to succeed.

   UNIX Account Management Module
     The UNIX account management component provides a function to perform
     account management, pam_sm_acct_mgmt().  The function verifies that the
     authenticated user is allowed to login to the local user account by
     checking the password expiry date.

     The following options may be passed to the management module:

     debug           syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

   UNIX Password Management Module
     The UNIX password management component provides a function to perform
     account management, pam_sm_chauthtok().  The function changes the user's
     password.

     The following options may be passed to the password module:

     debug           syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn         suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                     include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                     declined.

     local_pass      forces the password module to change a local password in
                     favour of a NIS one.

     nis_pass        forces the password module to change a NIS password in
                     favour of a local one.

FILES
     /etc/master.passwd  default UNIX password database.
