launchd(8)                BSD System Manager's Manual               launchd(8)

NAME
     launchd -- System wide and per-user daemon/agent manager

SYNOPSIS
     launchd [-d] [-D] [-s] [-S SessionType] [-- command [args ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     launchd manages processes, both for the system as a whole and for indi-
     vidual users.  The primary and preferred interface to launchd is via the
     launchctl(1) tool which (among other options) allows the user or adminis-
     trator to load and unload jobs.  Where possible, it is preferable for
     jobs to launch on demand based on criteria specified in their respective
     configuration files.

     When run with a command, a specific instance of launchd is created and
     the command is implicitly added to the list of jobs maintained by
     launchd.  If the command exits, that instance of launchd will clean up
     all jobs maintained by itself and exit. All children of the command will
     use that instance of launchd.

     During boot launchd is invoked by the kernel to run as the first process
     on the system and to further bootstrap the rest of the system.

OPTIONS
     -D       Debug. Prints syslog messages to stderr and adjusts logging via
              syslog(3) to LOG_DEBUG.

OPTIONS WHEN RUN AS PID 1
     -s       Single user mode. Instructs launchd to give a shell prompt
              before booting the system.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     LAUNCHD_SOCKET
              This variable is exported when invoking a command via the
              launchd command line. It informs launchctl how to find the cor-
              rect launchd to talk to.

NOTES
     In Darwin it is preferable to have your daemon launch via launchd instead
     of modifying rc or creating a SystemStarter Startup Item.

     At some point in the future, we hope to completely phase out the use of
     rc.
