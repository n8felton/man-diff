NAME
       cups-deviced - cups device daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cups-deviced request-id limit user-id options

DESCRIPTION
       cups-deviced polls the backends in /usr/libexec/cups/backend for a list
       of available devices.  It is run by cupsd(8) in response to a CUPS-Get-
       Devices  request.  The  output  format  is an IPP response message. The
       request-id argument is the request ID from the  original  IPP  request,
       typically  1.  The Ilimit argument is the limit value from the original
       IPP request - 0 means no limit. The user-id argument is the requesting-
       user-name  value  from  the original IPP request.  Finally, the options
       argument  is  a  space-delimited  list   of   attributes   ("name=value
       name=value  ...") that were passed in with the request. Currently cups-
       deviced looks for the requested-attributes attribute  and  tailors  the
       output accordingly.
