IDMAP_LDAP(8)                                                    IDMAP_LDAP(8)



NAME
       idmap_ldap - Samba's idmap_ldap Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The  idmap_ldap  plugin  provides  a  means  for  Winbind  to store and
       retrieve SID/uid/gid mapping tables in an LDAP directory  service.  The
       module implements both the "idmap" and "idmap alloc" APIs.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       ldap_base_dn = DN
          Defines  the  directory  base  suffix  to  use  when  searching  for
          SID/uid/gid mapping entries. If not defined, idmap_ldap will default
          to using the "ldap idmap suffix" option from smb.conf.

       ldap_user_dn = DN
          Defines  the  user  DN  to  be used for authentication. If absent an
          anonymous bind will be performed.

       ldap_url = ldap://server/
          Specifies the  LDAP  server  to  use  when  searching  for  existing
          SID/uid/gid map entries. If not defined, idmap_ldap will assume that
          ldap://localhost/ should be used.

       range = low - high
          Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the back-
          end is authoritative. Note that the range commonly matches the allo-
          cation range due to the fact that the same backend  will  store  and
          retrieve  SID/uid/gid  mapping  entries. If the parameter is absent,
          Winbind fail over to use the "idmap uid"  and  "idmap  gid"  options
          from smb.conf.

IDMAP ALLOC OPTIONS
       ldap_base_dn = DN
          Defines  the  directory base suffix under which new SID/uid/gid map-
          ping entries should be  stored.  If  not  defined,  idmap_ldap  will
          default to using the "ldap idmap suffix" option from smb.conf.

       ldap_user_dn = DN
          Defines  the  user  DN  to  be used for authentication. If absent an
          anonymous bind will be performed.

       ldap_url = ldap://server/
          Specifies the LDAP server to which modify/add/delete requests should
          be  sent.  If not defined, idmap_ldap will assume that ldap://local-
          host/ should be used.

       range = low - high
          Defines the available matching uid and gid range from which winbindd
          can  allocate for users and groups. If the parameter is absent, Win-
          bind fail over to use the "idmap uid" and "idmap gid"  options  from
          smb.conf.

EXAMPLES
       The  follow sets of a LDAP configuration which uses a slave server run-
       ning on localhost for fast fetching SID/gid/uid  mappings,  it  implies
       correct  configuration of referrals. The idmap alloc backend is pointed
       directly to the master to skip the referral (and  consequent  reconnec-
       tion  to the master) that the slave would return as allocation requires
       writing on the master.


            [global]
                idmap domains = ALLDOMAINS
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:default      = yes
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:backend      = ldap
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=example,dc=com
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:ldap_url     = ldap://localhost/
                idmap config ALLDOMAINS:range        = 10000 - 50000

                idmap alloc backend = ldap
                idmap alloc config:ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=example,dc=com
                idmap alloc config:ldap_url     = ldap://master.example.com/
                idmap alloc config:range        = 10000 - 50000


NOTE
       In order to use authentication against ldap servers  you  may  need  to
       provide  a  DN  and a password. To avoid exposing the password in plain
       text in the configuration file we store it into a security  store.  The
       "net  idmap " command is used to store a secret for the DN specified in
       a specific idmap domain.
