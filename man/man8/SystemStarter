SystemStarter(8)          BSD System Manager's Manual         SystemStarter(8)

NAME
     SystemStarter -- Start, stop, and restart system services

SYNOPSIS
     SystemStarter [-gvxdDqn] [action [service]]

DESCRIPTION
     The SystemStarter utility may be used to start, stop, and restart the
     system services which are described in the /Library/StartupItems/ and
     /System/Library/StartupItems/ paths.

     The optional action argument specifies which action SystemStarter per-
     forms on the startup items.  The optional service argument specifies
     which startup items to perform the action on.  If no service is speci-
     fied, all startup items will be acted on; otherwise, only the item pro-
     viding the service, any items it requires, or any items that depend on it
     will be acted on.

     During boot SystemStarter is invoked by rc (see rc(8)) and is responsible
     for starting all startup items in an order that satisfies each item's
     requirements.

ACTIONS
     start    start all items, or start the item that provides the specified
              service and all items providing services it requires.

     stop     stop all items, or stop the item that provides the specified
              service and all items that depend on it.

     restart  restart all items, or restart the item providing the specified
              service.

OPTIONS
     -g       (ignored)

     -v       verbose (text mode) startup

     -x       (ignored)

     -r       (ignored)

     -d       print debugging output

     -D       print debugging output and dependencies

     -q       be quiet (disable debugging output)

     -n       don't actually perform action on items (no-run mode)

NOTES
     Unless an explicit call to ConsoleMessage is made, SystemStarter examines
     the exit status of the startup item scripts to determine the success or
     failure of the services provided by that script.

     In Darwin it is preferable to create custom startup items than to modify
     rc, and at some point SystemStarter may entirely encompass the role of
     rc.

FILES
     /Library/StartupItems/         User-installed startup items.
     /System/Library/StartupItems/  System-provided startup items.

     SystemStarter was extended in Darwin 6.0 to support partial startup and
     interprocess communication.
