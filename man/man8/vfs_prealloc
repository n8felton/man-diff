VFS_PREALLOC(8)                                                VFS_PREALLOC(8)



NAME
       vfs_prealloc - preallocate matching files to a predetermined size

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = prealloc

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The vfs_prealloc VFS module preallocates files to a specified size each
       time a new file is created. This is useful in environments where  files
       are  of  a predetermined size will be written to a disk subsystem where
       extending file allocations is expensive.

       This module is stackable.

OPTIONS
       prealloc:EXT = BYTES
          Preallocate all files with the extension EXT to the  size  specified
          by BYTES.

          The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:

             o  K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes

             o  M - BYTES is a number of megabytes

             o  G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes

EXAMPLES
       A  process  writes  TIFF files to a Samba share, and the is known these
       files will almost always be around 4 megabytes (4194304 bytes):


               [frames]
            path = /data/frames
            vfs objects = prealloc
            prealloc:tiff = 4M


CAVEATS
       vfs_prealloc is not supported on all platforms  and  filesystems.  Cur-
       rently only XFS filesystems on Linux and IRIX are supported.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The  original  Samba  software  and  related  utilities were created by
       Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team  as  an  Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
