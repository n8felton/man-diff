NAME
       rotatelogs - Piped logging program to rotate Apache logs


SYNOPSIS
       rotatelogs [ -l ] [ -f ] logfile rotationtime|filesizeM [ offset ]



SUMMARY
       rotatelogs  is  a  simple  program for use in conjunction with Apache's
       piped logfile feature. It supports rotation based on a time interval or
       maximum size of the log.



OPTIONS
       -l     Causes the use of local time rather than GMT as the base for the
              interval or for strftime(3) formatting with size-based rotation.
              Note  that using -l in an environment which changes the GMT off-
              set (such as for BST or DST) can lead to unpredictable  results!

       -f     Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon as rotatel-
              ogs starts, instead of waiting for the first logfile entry to be
              read  (for  non-busy  sites,  there  may  be a substantial delay
              between when the server is started and when the first request is
              handled,  meaning  that  the associated logfile does not "exist"
              until then, which causes problems from  some  automated  logging
              tools). Available in version 2.2.9 and later.

       logfile
              The  path  plus basename of the logfile. If logfile includes any
              '%' characters, it is treated  as  a  format  string  for  strf-
              time(3).  Otherwise,  the  suffix  .nnnnnnnnnn  is automatically
              added and is the time in seconds. Both formats compute the start
              time from the beginning of the current period. For example, if a
              rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and  sec-
              ond fields created from the strftime(3) format will all be zero,
              referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour  period  (mid-
              night).

       rotationtime
              The  time  between  log  file rotations in seconds. The rotation
              occurs at the beginning of this interval. For  example,  if  the
              rotation  time  is  3600,  the  log  file will be rotated at the
              beginning of every hour; if the rotation time is 86400, the  log
              file  will  be  rotated  every night at midnight. (If no data is
              logged during an interval, no file will be created.)

       filesizeM
              The maximum file size in megabytes followed by the letter  M  to
              specify size rather than time.

       offset The  number  of  minutes  offset  from  UTC. If omitted, zero is
              assumed and UTC is used. For example, to use local time  in  the
              zone UTC -5 hours, specify a value of -300 for this argument. In
              most cases, -l should be used instead of specifying an offset.


EXAMPLES
            CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 86400" common



       This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.nnnn where nnnn is the  system
       time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a mul-
       tiple of the rotation time, so you can synchronize  cron  scripts  with
       it).  At  the end of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log
       is started.


            CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs -l /var/logs/logfile.%Y.%m.%d 86400" common



       This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.yyyy.mm.dd where yyyy  is  the
       year,  mm  is  the  month, and dd is the day of the month. Logging will
       switch to a new file every day at midnight, local time.


            CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 5M" common



       This configuration will rotate the logfile whenever it reaches  a  size
       of 5 megabytes.


            ErrorLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/errorlog.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5M"



       This  configuration will rotate the error logfile whenever it reaches a
       size of 5 megabytes, and the suffix to the logfile name will be created
       of the form errorlog.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS.


PORTABILITY
       The  following  logfile format string substitutions should be supported
       by all strftime(3) implementations, see the strftime(3)  man  page  for
       library-specific extensions.


       o %A - full weekday name (localized)


       o %a - 3-character weekday name (localized)


       o %B - full month name (localized)


       o %b - 3-character month name (localized)


       o %c - date and time (localized)


       o %d - 2-digit day of month


       o %H - 2-digit hour (24 hour clock)


       o %I - 2-digit hour (12 hour clock)


       o %j - 3-digit day of year


       o %M - 2-digit minute


       o %m - 2-digit month


       o %p - am/pm of 12 hour clock (localized)


       o %S - 2-digit second


       o %U - 2-digit week of year (Sunday first day of week)


       o %W - 2-digit week of year (Monday first day of week)


       o %w - 1-digit weekday (Sunday first day of week)


       o %X - time (localized)


       o %x - date (localized)


       o %Y - 4-digit year


       o %y - 2-digit year


       o %Z - time zone name


       o %% - literal `%'
