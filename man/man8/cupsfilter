NAME
       cupsfilter - convert a file to another format using cups filters

SYNOPSIS
       cupsfilter  [  -c  config-file  ]  [  -m mime/type ] [ -n copies ] [ -o

DESCRIPTION
       cupsfilter is a front-end to the CUPS filter subsystem which allows you
       to  convert a file to a specific format, just as if you had printed the
       file through CUPS. By default, cupsfilter generates a PDF file.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
            Uses the named cupsd.conf configuration file.

       -m mime/type
            Specifies the destination file type.  The  default  file  type  is
            application/pdf.

       -n copies
            Specifies the number of copies to generate.

       -o name=value
            Specifies options to pass to the CUPS filters.

       -p filename.ppd
            Specifies the PPD file to use.

       -t title
            Specifies the document title.

KNOWN ISSUES
       cupsfilter  currently does not use the filters defined in the PPD file.
       This will be addressed in a future CUPS release.
