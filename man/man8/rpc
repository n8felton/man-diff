RPC.YPPASSWDD(8)          BSD System Manager's Manual         RPC.YPPASSWDD(8)

NAME
     rpc.yppasswdd -- YP update password file daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rpc.yppasswdd [-d directory] [-noshell] [-nogecos] [-nopw]
                   [-m arg1 arg2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
     rpc.yppasswdd must be running on the YP master server to allow users to
     change information in the password file. If the user needs to change his
     password this is normally done with a program called yppasswd.  This pro-
     gram doesn't exist in OpenBSD but is integrated into passwd(1).  passwd
     will automatically determine which password database should be modified.
     To force a change of a YP password when a local one also exists, use
     passwd -y.

     Other user information can be changed with chpass(1).

     If the file /var/yp/yppasswdd.log exists then messages will be written to
     the file.

     The options are as follows:

     -d directory
             Use the specified directory to get at the password-related files
             instead of /etc.

     -noshell
             Don't allow changes of the shell field in the passwd file.

     -nogecos
             Don't allow changes of the gecos field in the passwd file.

     -nopw   Don't allow changes of the password in the passwd file.

     -m arg1 arg2 ...
             Don't use /var/yp/securenet.  Use another file with another file
             format. For futher information see man page for ypserv.acl.
