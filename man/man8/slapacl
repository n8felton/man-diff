SLAPACL(8C)                                                        SLAPACL(8C)



NAME
       slapacl - Check access to a list of attributes.

SYNOPSIS
       /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-106~5/Root/usr/sbin/slapacl   [-v]   [-d
       level] [-f slapd.conf] [-F confdir] [-D authcDN |  -U  authcID]  -b  DN
       [-u] [-X authzID | -o authzDN=DN] [attr[/access][:value]] [...]


DESCRIPTION
       Slapacl  is used to check the behavior of the slapd in verifying access
       to data according to ACLs, as specified in slapd.access(5).   It  opens
       the  slapd.conf(5) configuration file, reads in the access and default-
       access directives, and then parses the attr list given on the  command-
       line; if none is given, access to the entry pseudo-attribute is tested.


OPTIONS
       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -d level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified level.

       -f slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and  -F  are  specified,
              the  config  file will be read and converted to config directory
              format and written  to  the  specified  directory.   If  neither
              option  is  specified,  an  attempt  to  read the default config
              directory will be made before trying to use the  default  config
              file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config
              file is ignored.

       -D authcDN
              specify a DN to be used as identity  through  the  test  session
              when selecting appropriate <by> clauses in access lists.

       -U authcID
              specify  an  ID to be mapped to a DN as by means of authz-regexp
              or authz-rewrite rules (see slapd.conf(5) for details); mutually
              exclusive with -D.

       -X authzID
              specify  an authorization ID to be mapped to a DN as by means of
              authz-regexp  or  authz-rewrite  rules  (see  slapd.conf(5)  for
              details); mutually exclusive with -o authzDN=DN.

       -o option[=value]
              Specify   an   option   with   a(n  optional)  value.   Possible
              options/values are:

                     sockurl
                     domain
                     peername
                     sockname
                     ssf
                     transport_ssf
                     tls_ssf
                     sasl_ssf
                     authzDN

       -b DN  specify the DN which access is requested to;  the  corresponding
              entry is fetched from the database, and thus it must exist.  The
              DN is also used to determine what rules apply; thus, it must  be
              in the naming context of a configured database.  See also -u.

       -u     do  not fetch the entry from the database.  In this case, if the
              entry does not exist, a fake entry with the DN given with the -b
              option  is  used,  with  no attributes.  As a consequence, those
              rules that depend on the contents of the target object will  not
              behave as with the real object.  The DN given with the -b option
              is still used to select what rules apply; thus, it  must  be  in
              the naming context of a configured database.  See also -b.

EXAMPLES
       The command

            /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-106~5/Root/usr/sbin/slapacl -f //etc/openldap/slapd.conf -v \
                   -U bjorn -b "o=University of Michigan,c=US" \
                "o/read:University of Michigan"

       tests  whether  the  user bjorn can access the attribute o of the entry
       o=University of Michigan,c=US at read level.
