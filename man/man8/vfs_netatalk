VFS_NETATALK(8)                                                VFS_NETATALK(8)



NAME
       vfs_netatalk - hide .AppleDouble files from CIFS clients

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = netatalk

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The  vfs_netatalk VFS module dynamically hides .AppleDouble files, pre-
       venting spurious errors on some CIFS clients. .AppleDouble files may be
       created  by  historic implementations of AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) on
       servers.

       This module is stackable.

EXAMPLES
       Hide .AppleDouble files on the [data] share:


               [data]
            vfs objects = netatalk


CAVEATS
       This module is largely historic and unlikely to be  of  use  in  modern
       networks  since  current  Apple  systems  are able to mount CIFS shares
       natively.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were  created  by
       Andrew  Tridgell.  Samba  is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
