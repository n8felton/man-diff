NAME
       vfs_extd_audit - record selected Samba VFS operations

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = extd_audit

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The  extd_audit  VFS  module records selected client operations to both
       the smbd(8) log and system log (using syslog(3)).

       Other than logging to the smbd(8) log, vfs_extd_audit is  identical  to
       vfs_audit(8).

       This module is stackable.

       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
