DESCRIPTION
       cups-polld  polls  remote  servers for a list of available printers and
       printer classes every interval seconds.  Printer and class  information
       is  then broadcast to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) on the speci-

       This program is started automatically by  cupsd  for  every  BrowsePoll
       directive found in the cupsd.conf(5) file.
