NAME
     nbdst -- NetBoot deferred shadow tool

SYNOPSIS
     nbdst devnode shadowfile

DESCRIPTION
     nbdst is used during NetBoot to associate a shadow file with the disk
     image being used as the root device. After the shadow file is attached,
     subsequent writes to the root device will be redirected to the shadow
     file, which normally resides on local storage.  nbdst is invoked by
     /etc/rc.netboot

     The following arguments must be specified:
     devnode        The device node of the root device, in the form "disk0"
     shadowfile     Path to a shadow file which will be created and associated
                    with the NetBoot root device

NOTE
     nbdst can only be run as root.
