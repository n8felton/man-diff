ASLMANAGER(8)             BSD System Manager's Manual            ASLMANAGER(8)

NAME
     aslmanager -- Apple System Log data store file manager

SYNOPSIS
     aslmanager [-s store_dir] [-a [archive_dir]] [-ttl days] [-size max_size]

DESCRIPTION
     aslmanager manages files in the ASL data store written by the syslogd
     server.

     aslmanager is started automatically at various times.  It runs shortly
     after the syslogd server starts, at midnight (local time) if the system
     is running, and any time a file in the ASL data store directory
     (/var/log/asl) reaches a maximum size limit as specified to the syslogd
     server.

     aslmanager scans through the files in the ASL data store directory
     /var/log/asl, or some other directory specified following the -s flag.
     Files that contain only messages that are older than the default 2 day
     time-to-live are either archived or removed.  The default 2 day time-to-
     live value may be overridden by supplying a value following the -ttl
     flag.  A value of zero allows files to remain in the store with no time
     limit.

     A maximum size may be provided as a value following the -size flag.  This
     will cause aslmanager to archive (if -a is specified) and remove files
     until the total size of the data store is max_size bytes or less.  Files
     are removed in order starting from oldest to newest.  Files with the same
     date are removed in standard lexigraphic sort order by file name.

     Files are either removed entirely or copied to an archive directory.  If
     the -a flag is specified with no argument, files are copied to the
     /var/log/asl.archive directory.  An alternate directory path may be spec-
     ified following the -a flag.
