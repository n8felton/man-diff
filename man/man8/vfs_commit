VFS_COMMIT(8)                                                    VFS_COMMIT(8)



NAME
       vfs_commit - flush dirty data at specified intervals

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = commit

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The  vfs_commit VFS module keeps track of the amount of data written to
       a file and synchronizes it to disk when a specified amount accumulates.

       vfs_commit is useful in two circumstances. First, if you have very pre-
       cious data, the impact of unexpected power loss can be minimized  by  a
       small commit:dthresh value. Secondly, write performance can be improved
       on some systems by flushing file data early and at regular intervals.

       This module is stackable.

OPTIONS
       commit:dthresh = BYTES
          Synchronize file data each time the specified number  of  bytes  has
          been written.

          The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:

             o  K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes

             o  M - BYTES is a number of megabytes

             o  G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes

EXAMPLES
       Synchronize the file data on the [precious] share after every 512 kilo-
       bytes (524288 bytes) of data is written:


               [precious]
            path = /data/precious
            vfs objects = commit
            commit:dthresh = 512K


CAVEATS
       On some systems, the  data  synchronization  performed  by  commit  may
       reduce performance.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The  original  Samba  software  and  related  utilities were created by
       Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team  as  an  Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
