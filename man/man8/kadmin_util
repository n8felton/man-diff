kadmin_util(8)            BSD System Manager's Manual           kadmin_util(8)

NAME
     kadmin_util -- Kerberos -- Open Directory Single Sign On

SYNOPSIS
     kadmin_util -a principal_name -d principal_name [-r REALM] [-h] [-p]
                 [-v debug_level]

DESCRIPTION
     kadmin_util is a tool for managing the access control list used by
     kadmind to control which users have the ability to modify the Kerberos
     database of user information.  It will look at the acl_file item in the
     realm section of the kdc config file to determine which acl files to
     update.

     -a principal_name
              Adds the given principal name to the acl file with administrator
              privs.

     -d principal_name
              Removes the given principal name from the acl. (-a & -d are
              mutually exclusinve)

     -h       Send a HUP signal to kadmind if the update completes without
              errors

     -p       Write the output error to standard out in an XML Plist format

     -r REALM
              Denotes which realm to update. If this parameter is omitted,
              kadmin_util will operate on the first realm it finds in the kdc
              config file. To operate on all the available realms use '*' for
              the realm name

     -v debug_level
              Sets the debug level (1 = progress >1 for more detail)

EXAMPLES
     To add adminuser@REALM.COM to the acl file as kerberos administrator for
     realm REALM.COM

     kadmin_util -a adminuser@REALM.COM -r REALM.COM

     To remove adminuser@REALM.COM from all the realms serviced by this kdc
     (you need the quotes around the * to keep the shell from substituting
     filenames)

     kadmin_util -d adminuser@REALM.COM -r '*'

FILES
     /var/db/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl  the standard acl file location
     /var/db/krb5kdc/kdc.conf   the default kdc config file

DIAGNOSTICS
     You can add -v debug_level to any kadmin_util command. Debug level 1 pro-
     vides status information, higher levels add progressivly more levels of
     detail.

NOTES
     The kadmin_util tool is used by the Apple Single Sign On system to set up
     a KDC integrated with the rest of the Single Sign On components.
