FSCK_HFS(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              FSCK_HFS(8)

NAME
     fsck_hfs -- HFS file system consistency check

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_hfs -q [-df] special ...
     fsck_hfs -p [-df] special ...
     fsck_hfs [-n | -y | -r] [-dfgl] [-m mode] [-c size] special ...

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_hfs utility verifies and repairs standard HFS and HFS+ file sys-
     tems.

     The first form of fsck_hfs quickly checks the specified file systems to
     determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

     The second form of fsck_hfs preens the specified file systems.  It is
     normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic
     reboot, when a HFS file system is detected.  When preening file systems,
     fsck_hfs will fix common inconsistencies for file systems that were not
     unmounted cleanly.  If more serious problems are found, fsck_hfs does not
     try to fix them, indicates that it was not successful, and exits.

     The third form of fsck_hfs checks the specified file systems and tries to
     repair all detected inconsistencies.

     If no options are specified fsck_hfs will always check and attempt to fix
     the specified file systems.

     The options are as follows:

           -c size Specify the size of the cache used by fsck_hfs internally.
                   Bigger size can result in better performance but can result
                   in deadlock when used with -l option.  Size can be speci-
                   fied as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number.  If the
                   number ends with a ``k'', ``m'', or ``g'', the number is
                   multiplied by 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), or 1073741824 (1G),
                   respectively.

           -d      Display debugging information.  This option may provide
                   useful information when fsck_hfs cannot repair a damaged
                   file system.

           -f      When used with the -p option, force fsck_hfs to check
                   `clean' file systems, otherwise it means force fsck_hfs to
                   check and repair journaled HFS+ file systems.

           -g      Causes fsck_hfs to generate it's output strings in GUI for-
                   mat.  This option is used when another application with a
                   graphical user interface (like Mac OS X Disk Utility) is
                   envoking the fsck_hfs tool.

           -l      Lock down the file system and perform a test-only check.
                   This makes it possible to check a file system that is cur-
                   rently mounted, although no repairs can be made.

           -m mode Mode is an octal number that will be used to set the per-
                   missions for the lost+found directory when it is created.
                   The lost+found directory is only created when a volume is
                   repaired and orphaned files or directories are detected.
                   fsck_hfs places orphaned files and directories into the
                   lost+found directory (located at the root of the volume).
                   The default mode is 01777.

           -p      Preen the specified file systems.

           -q      Causes fsck_hfs to quickly check whether the volume was
                   unmounted cleanly.  If the volume was unmounted cleanly,
                   then the exit status is 0.  If the volume was not unmounted
                   cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.  In either
                   case, a message is printed to standard output describing
                   whether the volume was clean or dirty.

           -y      Always attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -n      Never attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -r      Rebuild the catalog file on the specified file system.
                   This option currently will only work if there is enough
                   contiguous space on the specified file system for a new
                   catalog file and if there is no damage to the leaf nodes in
                   the existing catalog file.

     Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
     the raw device should always be used.

BUGS
     fsck_hfs is not able to fix some inconsistencies that it detects.
