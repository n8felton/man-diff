NAME
     system_profiler -- reports system hardware and software configuration.

SYNOPSIS
     system_profiler [-usage]
     system_profiler [-listDataTypes]
     system_profiler [-xml] dataType1 ... dataTypeN
     system_profiler [-xml] [-detailLevel level]

DESCRIPTION
     system_profiler reports on the hardware and software configuration of the
     system.  It can generate plain text reports or XML reports which can be
     opened with SystemProfiler.app

     system_profiler is a replacement for /usr/sbin/AppleSystemProfiler.
     Unlike that earlier tool system_profiler does not rely on AppleScript or
     the Window Server and can be reliably used over a remote connection.

     The following options are available:

     -xml                Generates a report in XML format.  If the XML report
                         is redirected to a file with a ".spx" suffix that
                         file can be opened with System Profiler.app.

     -listDataTypes      Lists the available datatypes.

     -detailLevel level  Specifies the level of detail for the report:

                         mini          report with no personal information

                         basic         basic hardware and network information

                         full          all available information

     -usage              Prints usage info and examples.
