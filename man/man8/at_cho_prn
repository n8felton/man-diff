at_cho_prn(8)                                                    at_cho_prn(8)



NAME
       at_cho_prn  -  allows  you to choose a default printer on the AppleTalk
       internet

SYNOPSIS
       at_cho_prn [type[@zone]]

ARGUMENTS
       type[@zone]
               Specifies the type of printer to be used, and the  area  (zone)
               in which it resides.  If you don't use the type argument on the
               command line, at_cho_prn displays all  entities  of  the  types
               LaserWriter  and ImageWriter.  The system prompts you to select
               a printer by entering the appropriate number from  the  printer
               list display.  If you don't enter the zone part of the argument
               on the command line, at_cho_prn lists  all  the  zones  in  the
               internet and prompts you to choose the zone in which you'd like
               to select your default printer.


DESCRIPTION
       The at_cho_prn command displays a list of printer selections and  saves
       the  name of the printer that you select. The at_cho_prn command checks
       the network to determine which printers are registered on that network.

       After  you  specify  the  zone,  at_cho_prn lists the printers (of type
       type) available in that zone.

       The at_cho_prn command must be run while the user is logged in as root.


EXAMPLES
       The command

               at_cho_prn 'LaserWriter@*'

       produces output similar to this:

               ITEM  NET-ADDR     OBJECT : TYPE
                 1: 56bf.af.fc AnnLW:LaserWriter
                 2: 56bf.ac.cc TimLW:LaserWriter

               ITEM number (0 to make no selection)?

       where  NET-ADDR is the AppleTalk internet address (printed in hexadeci-
       mal) of the printer's listener socket, and OBJECT:TYPE is the  name  of
       the registered printer and its type.
