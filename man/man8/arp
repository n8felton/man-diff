ARP(8)                    BSD System Manager's Manual                   ARP(8)

NAME
     arp -- address resolution display and control

SYNOPSIS
     arp hostname
     arp -a
     arp -d hostname
     arp -s hostname ether_addr [temp] [pub]
     arp -f filename

DESCRIPTION
     The arp program displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address
     translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp(4)).
     With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry for hostname.
     The host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot nota-
     tion.

     Available options:

     -a      The program displays all of the current ARP entries.

     -d      A super-user may delete an entry for the host called hostname
             with the -d flag.

     -s hostname ether_addr
             Create an ARP entry for the host called hostname with the Ether-
             net address ether_addr.  The Ethernet address is given as six hex
             bytes separated by colons.  The entry will be permanent unless
             the word temp is given in the command.  If the word pub is given,
             the entry will be "published"; i.e., this system will act as an
             ARP server, responding to requests for hostname even though the
             host address is not its own.

     -f      Causes the file filename to be read and multiple entries to be
             set in the ARP tables.  Entries in the file should be of the form

                   hostname ether_addr [temp] [pub]

             with argument meanings as given above.
