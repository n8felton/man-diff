USEREVENTAGENT(8)         BSD System Manager's Manual        USEREVENTAGENT(8)

NAME
     UserEventAgent -- utility to manage user callbacks in response to events

SYNOPSIS
     UserEventAgent [-vdflh] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
     The UserEventAgent utility is responsible for loading plugins that pro-
     vide for system response to user-generated events.  It is not intended to
     be run directly, but rather started by the system.  The few options it
     has are intended as debugging aids.  Typically, allowing the system to
     start UserEventAgent by itself, without any additional options, is the
     ideal configuration.

     The options are as follows:

     -v    Verbose mode.  Error and status messages are written to stderr.

     -d    Debug mode.  Each plugin will be forked off into its own child
           process, to aid debugging.

     -f    Force load.  Normally, the plugin directory must be owned by the
           root user and wheel group; this flag overrides that check.

     -l sessiontype
           Some jobs only make sense in certain contexts. This flag instructs
           UserEventAgent to only load plugins for the given session type; for
           more info, see the documentation for launchctl(1)

     -h    Help.  This displays usage information.

     Optionally, a directory may be specified after all options on the command
     line; this will cause this directory to be used instead of the default,
     /System/Library/UserEventPlugins.
