NAME
     notifyd -- notification server

SYNOPSIS
     notifyd [-d service_name] [-v] [-shm_pages npages] [-no_restart]

DESCRIPTION
     notifyd is the server for the Mac OS X notification system described in
     notify(3).  The server is usually started automatically during system
     startup, and is not run from the command line.

     The -d option causes notifyd to run in a debugging mode.  It registers
     its mach port with the given service name.  It will stay attached to the
     terminal and print verbose log messages to the terminal.

     The -v option causes notifyd to produce verbose logging information.

     The -shm_pages npages option sets the number of shared memory pages used
     for passive notification.  The default is one page.  If a value of zero
     is specified, shared memory is disabled, and passive notifications are
     performed using IPC between the client and the server.

     The -no_restart option causes notifyd to register as a non-restartable
     server with mach_init.
