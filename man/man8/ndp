DESCRIPTION
     The ndp command manipulates the address mapping table used by Neighbor
     Discovery Protocol (NDP).

     -a      Dump the currently existing NDP entries.

     -A wait
             Repeat -a (dump NDP entries) every wait seconds.

     -c      Erase all the NDP entries.

     -d      Delete specified NDP entry.

     -f      Parse the file specified by filename.

     -H      Harmonize consistency between the routing table and the default
             router list; install the top entry of the list into the kernel
             routing table.

     -I [delete | interface]
             Shows or specifies the default interface used as the default
             route when there is no default router.  If no argument is given
             to the option, the current default interface will be shown.  If
             an interface is specified, the interface will be used as the
             default.  If a special keyword delete is specified, the current
             default interface will be deleted from the kernel.

     -i interface [flags...]
             View ND information for the specified interface.  If additional
             arguments flags are given, ndp sets or clears the specified flags
             for the interface.  Possible flags are as follows.  All of the
             flags can begin with the special character `-', which means the
             flag should be cleared.
             nud     turn on or off NUD (Neighbor Unreachability Detection) on
                     the interface.  NUD is usually turned on by default.

     -n      Do not try to resolve numeric address to hostname.

     -p      Show prefix list.

     -P      Flush all the entries in the prefix list.

     -r      Show default router list.

     -R      Flush all the entries in the default router list.

     -s      Register an NDP entry for a node.  The entry will be permanent
             unless the word temp is given in the command.  If the word proxy
             is given, this system will act as an proxy NDP server, responding
             to requests for hostname even though the host address is not its
             own.

     -t      Print timestamp on each entries, to make it possible to merge
             output with tcpdump(1).  Most useful when used with -A.

RETURN VALUES
     The ndp command will exit with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
