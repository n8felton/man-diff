NAME
     security_authtrampoline -- Trampoline used by AuthorizationExecuteWith-
     Privileges from Security.framework.

SYNOPSIS
     security_authtrampoline

DESCRIPTION
     security_authtrampoline is used when programs use AuthorizationExecute-
     WithPrivileges from Security.framework to run another program with root
     privileges.  The security_authtrampoline command uses the authorization
     infrastructure to determine whether it should proceed.  You should not
     run it by itself.  Execution of other programs is logged with syslog(3)
     to channel LOG_AUTH at LOG_NOTICE level.
