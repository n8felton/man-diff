DESCRIPTION
       pcscd is the daemon program for pcsc-lite and musclecard framework.  It
       is  a  resource manager that coordinates communications with smart-card
       readers and smart cards and cryptographic tokens that are connected  to
       the system.

       pcscd  is  normally  started  at  boot  time from /System/Library/Star-
       tupItems/SmartCardServices.  It allows  applications  to  access  smart
       cards and readers without knowing details of the card or reader.

       pcscd  coordinates the loading of drivers for card readers and plug-ins
       for different card types.

       The purpose of pcsc-lite is to provide both a cross compatible API  for
       migrating  Windows  based  PCSC  applications  to Unix and to provide a
       pluggable architecture  for  supporting  smartcards  and  cryptographic
       tokens through high level API's.

       At  startup, pcscd loads the smart card reader drivers specified in the
       /etc/reader.conf file (or specified using -c file).

       When a smart card is inserted into a reader, pcscd uses the ATR  string
       from  the  card  to identify this card.  The /usr/libexec/SmartCardSer-
       vices/services directory contains plug-ins for the card.   These  plug-
       ins  are searched.  If the ATR string matches, the client library loads
       that plug-in for that token.


USB SMART CARD READER DRIVERS
       USB Smart card reader drivers are placed in the /usr/libexec/SmartCard-
       Services/drivers directory. Each driver is simply a bundle.  The bundle
       contains an XML file Info.plist which is parsed by  pcscd.   This  file
       contains  the  vendor  and  product id of the device.  This information
       allows pcscd to automatically determine when a reader  is  inserted  or
       removed.


SERIAL SMART CARD READER DRIVERS
       Serial  Smart card reader drivers are placed in the /usr/libexec/Smart-
       CardServices/drivers directory. Each driver is simply a  shared  object
       file.  The pcscd locates serial drivers with the /etc/reader.conf file.
       The file has the following format:

        # comment
        FRIENDLYNAME <Descriptive name>
        DEVICENAME   <Short name>
        LIBPATH      <Location of the driver library>
        CHANNELID    <Hexadecimal channel identificator>


       FRIENDLYNAME
              is a user-friendly name of the reader that  is  served  by  this
              driver.  This name is displayed to the user when necessary.


       DEVICENAME
              is  a  driver  specific  value.   If you do not know this value,
              GEN_SMART_RDR is a good choice.

       LIBPATH
              is the full path to the shared library.


       CHANNELID
              is the channel ID for  serial-port,  smart-card  readers.   This
              could  vary  depending  on  the  driver in which you are using -
              check the driver README for more information.  Some use the fol-
              lowing:

               /dev/ttyS0 (COM1) ->  0x0103F8 or 1
               /dev/ttyS1 (COM2) ->  0x0102F8 or 2
               /dev/ttyS2 (COM3) ->  0x0103E8 or 3
               /dev/ttyS3 (COM4) ->  0x0102E8 or 4

       Example:

        # Configuration file for pcsc-lite

        FRIENDLYNAME "My Smartcard Reader"
        DEVICENAME   GEN_SMART_RDR
        LIBPATH      /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/my_reader.so
        CHANNELID    0x0103F8

        # End of file

       Multiple drivers can be listed in /etc/reader.conf.

       Drivers are available at http://www.musclecard.com/drivers.html.

SMART CARD PLUG-INS
       pcsc-lite uses plug-ins to handle different types of smart cards. There
       is a plug-in for each smart-card type. Plug-ins are  installed  in  the
       /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/services    directory.    Plug-ins   for
       cards/tokens are available from the MUSCLE web site  http://www.muscle-
       card.com.

FILES
       /etc/reader.conf : Reader configuration file
       /System/Library/StartupItems/SmartCardServices : pcscd startup script
       /var/run/pcscd.pid : process id of the running pcscd
       /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/  : directory containing bundles
       for USB drivers"
