NAME
       named-checkconf - named configuration file syntax checking tool

SYNOPSIS
       named-checkconf [-v] [-j] [-t directory] {filename} [-z]

DESCRIPTION
       named-checkconf checks the syntax, but not the semantics, of a named
       configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -t directory
           Chroot to directory so that include directives in the configuration
           file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.

       -v
           Print the version of the named-checkconf program and exit.

       -z
           Perform a test load of all master zones found in named.conf.

       -j
           When loading a zonefile read the journal if it exists.

       filename
           The name of the configuration file to be checked. If not specified,
           it defaults to /etc/named.conf.

RETURN VALUES
       named-checkconf returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and
       0 otherwise.
