NAME
     mDNSResponder -- Multicast DNS daemon

SYNOPSIS
     mDNSResponder

DESCRIPTION
     mDNSResponder (also known as mdnsd on some systems) is a daemon invoked
     at boot time to implement Multicast DNS and DNS Service Discovery.

     mDNSResponder listens UDP port 5353 for Multicast DNS Query packets.
     When it receives a query for which it knows an answer, mDNSResponder
     issues the appropriate Multicast DNS Reply packet.

     mDNSResponder also performs Multicast DNS Queries on behalf of client
     processes, and maintains a cache of the replies.

     mDNSResponder has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users
     should not run mDNSResponder manually.

     To examine mDNSResponder's internal state, for debugging and diagnostic
     purposes, send it a SIGINFO signal, and it will then dump a snapshot sum-
     mary of its internal state to /var/log/system.log, e.g.

           sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder

FILES
     /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder

     cially supported by Apple) are mDNSResponder daemons for other platforms,
     including Mac OS 9, Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris,
     and other POSIX systems.
