VFS_CAP(8)                                                          VFS_CAP(8)



NAME
       vfs_cap - CAP encode filenames

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = cap

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       CAP  (Columbia  Appletalk  Protocol) encoding is a technique for repre-
       senting non-ASCII filenames in ASCII. The vfs_cap VFS module translates
       filenames to and from CAP format, allowing users to name files in their
       native encoding.

       CAP encoding is most commonly used in Japanese language environments.

       This module is stackable.

EXAMPLES
       On a system using GNU libiconv, use CAP encoding to  support  users  in
       the Shift_JIS locale:


               [global]
            dos charset = CP932
            dos charset = CP932
            vfs objects = cap
