PIPE(8)                                                                PIPE(8)



NAME
       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command

SYNOPSIS
       pipe [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

DESCRIPTION
       The pipe(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue manager to
       deliver messages to external commands.  This program expects to be  run
       from the master(8) process manager.

       Message  attributes such as sender address, recipient address and next-
       hop host name can be specified as command-line macros that are expanded
       before the external command is executed.

       The  pipe(8)  daemon  updates  queue files and marks recipients as fin-
       ished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery  should  be  tried
       again  at  a  later  time.  Delivery  status  reports  are  sent to the
       bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY
       Some external commands cannot handle more than one recipient per deliv-
       ery request. Examples of such transports are pagers or fax machines.

       To  prevent  Postfix  from  sending  multiple  recipients  per delivery
       request, specify

           transport_destination_recipient_limit = 1

       in the Postfix main.cf file, where transport is the name in  the  first
       column  of  the  Postfix  master.cf  entry  for the pipe-based delivery
       transport.

COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
       The external command attributes are given in the master.cf file at  the
       end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:

       chroot=pathname (optional)
              Change  the  process root directory and working directory to the
              named directory. This happens before switching to the privileges
              specified  with  the  user  attribute,  and before executing the
              optional directory=pathname directive. Delivery is  deferred  in
              case of failure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.

       directory=pathname (optional)
              Change to the named directory before executing the external com-
              mand.  The directory must be accessible for the  user  specified
              with the user attribute (see below).  The default working direc-
              tory is $queue_directory.  Delivery is deferred in case of fail-
              ure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

       eol=string (optional, default: \n)
              The output record delimiter. Typically one would use either \r\n
              or \n. The usual C-style backslash escape sequences  are  recog-
              nized:  \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \ddd (up to three octal digits) and
              \\.

       flags=BDFORhqu.> (optional)
              Optional message processing flags.  By  default,  a  message  is
              copied unchanged.

              B      Append  a  blank line at the end of each message. This is
                     required by some mail user agents that recognize "From  "
                     lines only when preceded by a blank line.

              D      Prepend  a  "Delivered-To: recipient" message header with
                     the envelope recipient address. Note: for this  to  work,
                     the transport_destination_recipient_limit must be 1.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              F      Prepend a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header to the
                     message content.  This is expected by, for example,  UUCP
                     software.

              O      Prepend an "X-Original-To: recipient" message header with
                     the recipient address as given to Postfix. Note: for this
                     to  work,  the transport_destination_recipient_limit must
                     be 1.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              R      Prepend a Return-Path: message header with  the  envelope
                     sender address.

              h      Fold the command-line $recipient domain name and $nexthop
                     host name to lower case.  This is recommended for  deliv-
                     ery via UUCP.

              q      Quote  white  space  and  other special characters in the
                     command-line $sender and  $recipient  address  localparts
                     (text to the left of the right-most @ character), accord-
                     ing to an 8-bit transparent version of RFC 822.  This  is
                     recommended for delivery via UUCP or BSMTP.

                     The result is compatible with the address parsing of com-
                     mand-line recipients by the Postfix sendmail(1) mail sub-
                     mission command.

                     The q flag affects only entire addresses, not the partial
                     address information from the $user, $extension or  $mail-
                     box command-line macros.

              u      Fold  the command-line $recipient address localpart (text
                     to the left of the right-most @ character) to lower case.
                     This is recommended for delivery via UUCP.

              .      Prepend  "."  to  lines starting with ".". This is needed
                     by, for example, BSMTP software.

              >      Prepend ">" to lines  starting  with  "From  ".  This  is
                     expected by, for example, UUCP software.

       null_sender=replacement (default: MAILER-DAEMON)
              Replace  the  null  sender  address (typically used for delivery
              status notifications) with the specified text when expanding the
              $sender  command-line  macro,  and  when  generating  a From_ or
              Return-Path: message header.

              If the null sender replacement text is a non-empty  string  then
              it is affected by the q flag for address quoting in command-line
              arguments.

              The null sender replacement text may be empty; this form is rec-
              ommended  for  content filters that feed mail back into Postfix.
              The empty sender address is not  affected  by  the  q  flag  for
              address quoting in command-line arguments.

              Caution:  a  null  sender  address is easily mis-parsed by naive
              software. For example, when the pipe(8) daemon executes  a  com-
              mand such as:

                  command -f$sender -- $recipient (bad)

              the  command  will mis-parse the -f option value when the sender
              address is a null string.  For correct parsing, specify  $sender
              as an argument by itself:

                  command -f $sender -- $recipient (good)

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       size=size_limit (optional)
              Messages  greater  in  size  than  this limit (in bytes) will be
              returned to the sender as undeliverable.

       user=username (required)

       user=username:groupname
              Execute the external command with the rights  of  the  specified
              username.   The  software  refuses to execute commands with root
              privileges, or with the privileges of the mail system owner.  If
              groupname  is  specified,  the  corresponding  group  ID is used
              instead of the group ID of username.

       argv=command... (required)
              The command to be executed. This must be specified as  the  last
              command attribute.  The command is executed directly, i.e. with-
              out interpretation of shell meta characters by a  shell  command
              interpreter.

              In  the command argument vector, the following macros are recog-
              nized and replaced with corresponding information from the Post-
              fix queue manager delivery request.

              In addition to the form ${name}, the forms $name and $(name) are
              also recognized.  Specify $$ where a single $ is wanted.

              ${client_address}
                     This macro expands to the remote client network  address.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${client_helo}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the  remote client HELO command
                     parameter.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${client_hostname}
                     This macro expands to the remote client hostname.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${client_protocol}
                     This macro expands to the remote client protocol.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${extension}
                     This macro expands to the extension part of  a  recipient
                     address.   For  example,  with an address user+foo@domain
                     the extension is foo.

                     A  command-line  argument  that   contains   ${extension}
                     expands  into as many command-line arguments as there are
                     recipients.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case fold-
                     ing.

              ${mailbox}
                     This macro expands to the complete local part of a recip-
                     ient   address.    For   example,   with    an    address
                     user+foo@domain the mailbox is user+foo.

                     A  command-line argument that contains ${mailbox} expands
                     to as many command-line arguments as  there  are  recipi-
                     ents.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case fold-
                     ing.

              ${nexthop}
                     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.

                     This information is modified by the h flag for case fold-
                     ing.

              ${recipient}
                     This macro expands to the complete recipient address.

                     A   command-line   argument  that  contains  ${recipient}
                     expands to as many command-line arguments  as  there  are
                     recipients.

                     This information is modified by the hqu flags for quoting
                     and case folding.

              ${sasl_method}
                     This macro expands to the SASL  authentication  mechanism
                     used during the reception of the message. An empty string
                     is passed if the message has been received  without  SASL
                     authentication.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${sasl_sender}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the  SASL sender name (i.e. the
                     original submitter as  per  RFC  2554)  used  during  the
                     reception of the message.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${sasl_username}
                     This  macro expands to the SASL user name used during the
                     reception of the message. An empty string  is  passed  if
                     the  message  has  been received without SASL authentica-
                     tion.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              ${sender}
                     This macro expands to the  envelope  sender  address.  By
                     default,  the  null sender address expands to MAILER-DAE-
                     MON; this can be changed with the null_sender  attribute,
                     as described above.

                     This information is modified by the q flag for quoting.

              ${size}
                     This macro expands to Postfix's idea of the message size,
                     which is an approximation of the size of the  message  as
                     delivered.

              ${user}
                     This  macro  expands  to the username part of a recipient
                     address.  For example, with  an  address  user+foo@domain
                     the username part is user.

                     A  command-line  argument  that  contains ${user} expands
                     into as many command-line arguments as there are  recipi-
                     ents.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case fold-
                     ing.

STANDARDS
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Command exit status  codes  are  expected  to  follow  the  conventions
       defined in <sysexits.h>.  Exit status 0 means normal successful comple-
       tion.

       Postfix version 2.3 and later support RFC  3463-style  enhanced  status
       codes.   If  a  command terminates with a non-zero exit status, and the
       command output begins with an enhanced status code,  this  status  code
       takes precedence over the non-zero exit status.

       Problems  and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
       queue for further inspection.

SECURITY
       This  program needs a dual personality 1) to access the private Postfix
       queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2) to execute external  commands  as  the
       specified user. It is therefore security sensitive.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically as pipe(8) processes run
       for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"  to
       speed up a change.

       The  text  below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS
       In the text below, transport is the first field in a master.cf entry.

       transport_destination_concurrency_limit   ($default_destination_concur-
       rency_limit)
              Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination,
              for  delivery via the named transport.  The limit is enforced by
              the Postfix queue manager.

       transport_destination_recipient_limit     ($default_destination_recipi-
       ent_limit)
              Limit the number of recipients per message delivery, for  deliv-
              ery via the named transport.  The limit is enforced by the Post-
              fix queue manager.

       transport_time_limit ($command_time_limit)
              Limit the time for delivery to external  command,  for  delivery
              via  the  named  transport.   The  limit is enforced by the pipe
              delivery agent.

              Postfix 2.4 and later support a suffix that specifies  the  time
              unit:  s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
              The default time unit is seconds.

MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS
       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The default location of the Postfix main.cf and  master.cf  con-
              figuration files.

       daemon_timeout (18000s)
              How  much  time  a  Postfix  daemon process may take to handle a
              request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.

       delay_logging_resolution_limit (2)
              The maximal number of digits after the decimal point  when  log-
              ging sub-second delay values.

       export_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The  list  of  environment variables that a Postfix process will
              export to non-Postfix processes.

       ipc_timeout (3600s)
              The time limit for sending  or  receiving  information  over  an
              internal communication channel.

       mail_owner (postfix)
              The  UNIX  system  account  that owns the Postfix queue and most
              Postfix daemon processes.

       max_idle (100s)
              The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix  daemon  process
              waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.

       max_use (100)

              The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.

       recipient_delimiter (empty)
              The   separator   between  user  names  and  address  extensions
              (user+foo).

       syslog_facility (mail)
              The syslog facility of Postfix logging.

       syslog_name (postfix)
              The mail system name that is prepended to the  process  name  in
              syslog  records,  so  that  "smtpd" becomes, for example, "post-
              fix/smtpd".
