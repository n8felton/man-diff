TDBBACKUP(8)                                                      TDBBACKUP(8)



NAME
       tdbbackup  -  tool  for  backing up and for validating the integrity of
       samba .tdb files

SYNOPSIS
       tdbbackup [-s suffix] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(1) suite.

       tdbbackup is a tool that may be used to backup samba .tdb  files.  This
       tool  may  also be used to verify the integrity of the .tdb files prior
       to samba startup or during normal operation. If it  finds  file  damage
       and it finds a prior backup the backup file will be restored.

OPTIONS
       -h
          Get help information.

       -s suffix
          The  -s  option  allows the adminisistrator to specify a file backup
          extension. This way it is possible to keep a history of  tdb  backup
          files by using a new suffix for each backup.

       -v
          The  -v  will check the database for damages (currupt data) which if
          detected causes the backup to be restored.

COMMANDS
       GENERAL INFORMATION

       The tdbbackup utility can safely be run at any time. It was designed so
       that it can be used at any time to validate the integrity of tdb files,
       even during Samba operation. Typical usage for the command will be:

       tdbbackup [-s suffix] *.tdb

       Before restarting samba the following command may be  run  to  validate
       .tdb files:

       tdbbackup -v [-s suffix] *.tdb

       Samba .tdb files are stored in various locations, be sure to run backup
       all .tdb file on the system. Important files includes:

       o   secrets.tdb - usual location  is  in  the  /usr/local/samba/private
          directory, or on some systems in /etc/samba.

       o    passdb.tdb  -  usual  location  is in the /usr/local/samba/private
          directory, or on some systems in /etc/samba.

       o   *.tdb located in the /usr/local/samba/var directory or on some sys-
          tems in the /var/cache or /var/lib/samba directories.
