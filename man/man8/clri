CLRI(8)                   BSD System Manager's Manual                  CLRI(8)

NAME
     clri -- clear an inode

SYNOPSIS
     clri special_device inode_number ...

DESCRIPTION
     Clri is obsoleted for normal file system repair work by fsck(8).

     Clri zeros out the inodes with the specified inode number(s) on the
     filesystem residing on the given special_device.  The fsck(8) utility is
     usually run after clri to reclaim the zero'ed inode(s) and the blocks
     previously claimed by those inode(s).  Both read and write permission are
     required on the specified special_device.

     The primary purpose of this routine is to remove a file which for some
     reason is not being properly handled by fsck(8).  Once removed, it is
     anticipated that fsck(8) will be able to clean up the resulting mess.

SEE ALSO
     fsck(8), fsdb(8), icheck(8), ncheck(8)

BUGS
     If the file is open, the work of clri will be lost when the inode is
     written back to disk from the inode cache.
