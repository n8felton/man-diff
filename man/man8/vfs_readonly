VFS_READONLY(8)                                                VFS_READONLY(8)



NAME
       vfs_readonly - make a Samba share read only for a specified time period

SYNOPSIS
       vfs objects = readonly

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The vfs_readonly VFS module marks a share as read only for all  clients
       connecting within the configured time period. Clients connecting during
       this time will be denied write access to all files in the share,  irre-
       spective of ther actual access privileges.

       This module is stackable.

OPTIONS
       readonly:period = BEGIN, END
          Only  mark  the share as read only if the client connection was made
          between the times marked by the BEGIN and END date  specifiers.  The
          syntax  of these date specifiers is the same as that accepted by the
          -d option of GNU date(1).

EXAMPLES
       Mark all shares read only:


               [global]
            vfs objects = readonly


       Mark the [backup] share as read only during business hours:


               [backup]
            path = /readonly
            vfs objects = readonly
            readonly:period = readonly:period = "today 9:00","today 17:00"
