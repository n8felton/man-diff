MOUNT_NTFS(8)             BSD System Manager's Manual            MOUNT_NTFS(8)

NAME
     mount_ntfs -- mount an NTFS file system

SYNOPSIS
     mount_ntfs [-o options] special node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_ntfs command attaches the NTFS file system residing on the
     device special to the global file system namespace at the location indi-
     cated by node.  This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot
     time, but can be used by any user to mount an NTFS file system on any
     directory that they own (provided, of course, that they have appropriate
     access to the device that contains the file system).

     The options are as follows:

     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma sepa-
             rated string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible
             options and their meanings.
