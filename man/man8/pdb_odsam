PDB_ODSAM(8)                                                      PDB_ODSAM(8)



NAME
       pdb_odsam - Open Directory account information database for smbd

SYNOPSIS
       The  pdb_odsam plugin is the default account information database back-
       end used on Mac OS X. It makes users and groups record from Open Direc-
       tory available to Samba.


       idmap_odsam  should always be used in conjunction with the odsam passdb
       backend.


OPTIONS
       odsam: map guest to guest = BOOL
              If this is true (the default), pdb_odsam map the  literal  user-
              name "guest" to the configured guest account. This makes "guest"
              an alias for the configured guest account regardless of  whether
              an account named "guest" exists or not.


       odsam: msglevel = LEVEL
              LEVEL  is  the  integer log level at which pdb_odsam should emit
              log messages.  The lower LEVEL is, the more verbose the log mes-
              sages.


       odsam: traceall = BOOL
              If  this  is true, pdb_odsam will emit log messages for all Open
              Directory calls. If it is false (the default), it will only  log
              errors.


EXAMPLES
            [global]
                idmap domain = default
                idmap config default:default = yes
                idmap config default:backend = odsam

                idmap alloc backend = odsam

                passdb backend = odsam

                odsam: msglevel = 0    # Log at debugging levels
                odsam: traceall = no   # Do not trace Open Directory calls
