NAME
     sa2 -- Generate a system activity daily report file.

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/sa/sa2 [-dgpu] [-n mode] [-e time] [-f filename] [-i seconds]
                     [-s time]

DESCRIPTION
     The sa2 command is a shell script used to invoke the system activity
     reporter sar for purposes of generating the standard default daily report
     file.  The report file generated is, /var/log/sa/sardd where the dd rep-
     resents the current day of the month.  The sa2 options are the same as
     those documented in sar(1).

     When sa2 runs, it will also remove data and report files, found in
     /var/log/sa, that are more than one week old.

     The sa2 command is intended to be started by cron.

EXAMPLE CRON ENTRY
     # Starting at 8am collect system activity records
     # every 20 minutes for 12 hours
     # 20 minutes = 1200 seconds
     # 12 hours with 3 samples each hour = 36 loops

     0 8 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1 1200 36

     # After the 12 hour period,
     # collect a system activity report

     30 20 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -A
