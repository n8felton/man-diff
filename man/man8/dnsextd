NAME
     dnsextd -- BIND Extension Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     dnsextd

DESCRIPTION
     dnsextd is a daemon invoked at boot time, running alongside BIND 9, to
     implement two EDNS0 extensions to the standard DNS protocol.

     dnsextd allows clients to perform DNS Updates with an attached lease
     lifetime, so that if the client crashes or is disconnected from the net-
     work, its address records will be automatically deleted after the lease
     expires.

     dnsextd allows clients to perform long-lived queries. Instead of rapidly
     polling the server to discover when information changes, long-lived
     queries enable a client to indicate its interest in some set of data, and
     then be notified asynchronously by the server whenever any of that data
     changes.

     dnsextd has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users should
     not run dnsextd manually.
