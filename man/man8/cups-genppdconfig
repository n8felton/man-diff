CUPS-GENPPDCONFIG(8)        Gutenprint Manual Pages       CUPS-GENPPDCONFIG(8)



NAME
       cups-genppdconfig  -  a  user-friendly interface to generate Gutenprint
       PPD files for use with CUPS

SYNOPSIS
       cups-genppdconfig [-d ppd_directory]
       update-cups-genppd [-d pdd_directory]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-genppdconfig generates Gutenprint PPD files  for  use  with  CUPS.
       The  program  allows  the selection of the base directory to create the
       PPDs in, and the printers and languages desired.  The default  settings
       are taken from the contents of the base directory.  Note that unselect-
       ing an item will not remove it from the disk; you must remove  unwanted
       printers  and  languages  by deleting the files and directories respec-
       tively.

       If dialog is installed, it will be used to create the  user  interface,
       using  colour,  3D-look  dialog  boxes etc.  If dialog cannot be found,
       perlmenu will be used instead to create a simpler, though  functionally
       identical, interface.

OPTIONS
       -d ppd-directory
              Use  ppd-directory as the base directory to create PPD files in.
              The  default  printer  and  language  selections  will  also  be
              obtained from this directory.  By default, the base directory is
              /usr/share/cups/model/gutenprint.
