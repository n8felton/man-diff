       (Trivial DataBase) file to standard output in a human-readable  format.

       intended for those who are somewhat familiar with Samba internals.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were  created  by
       Andrew  Tridgell.  Samba  is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The tdbdump man page was written by Jelmer Vernooij.
