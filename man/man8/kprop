KPROP(8)                                                              KPROP(8)



NAME
       kprop - propagate a Kerberos V5 principal database to a slave server

SYNOPSIS
       kprop [-r realm] [-f file] [-d] [-P port] [-s keytab] slave_host

DESCRIPTION
       kprop  is  used  to propagate a Kerberos V5 database dump file from the
       master Kerberos server to a slave Kerberos server, which is specfied by
       slave_host.   This  is done by transmitting the dumped database file to
       the slave server over an encrypted, secure channel.  The dump file must
       be   created   by   kdb5_util,   and   is  normally  KPROP_DEFAULT_FILE
       (/var/db/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans).

OPTIONS
       -r realm
              specifies the realm of the master server; by default  the  realm
              returned by krb5_default_local_realm(3) is used.

       -f file
              specifies  the filename where the dumped principal database file
              is  to  be  found;  by  default  the  dumped  database  file  is
              KPROP_DEFAULT_FILE (normally /var/db/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans).

       -P port
              specifies  the  port  to use to contact the kpropd server on the
              remote host.

       -d     prints debugging information.

       -s keytab
              specifies the location of the keytab file.
