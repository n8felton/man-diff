Clam Daemon(8)                  Clam AntiVirus                  Clam Daemon(8)



NAME
       clamd - an anti-virus daemon

SYNOPSIS
       clamd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  daemon  listens for incoming connections on Unix and/or TCP socket
       and scans files or directories on demand. It  reads  the  configuration
       from /private/etc/clamd.conf

COMMANDS
       clamd recognizes the following commands:


       PING   Check the server's state. It should reply with "PONG".

       VERSION
              Print program and database versions.

       RELOAD Reload the virus databases.

       SHUTDOWN
              Perform a clean exit.

       SCAN file/directory
              Scan  a  file  or a directory (recursively) with archive support
              enabled  (if  not  disabled  in  clamd.conf).  A  full  path  is
              required.

       CONTSCAN file/directory
              Scan  file  or  directory  (recursively)  with  archive  support
              enabled and don't stop the scanning when a virus is found.

       MULTISCAN file/directory
              Scan file in a standard  way  or  scan  directory  (recursively)
              using  multiple  threads  (to  make  the  scanning faster on SMP
              machines).

       STREAM Scan stream - on this command clamd will  return  "PORT  number"
              you should connect to and send data to scan.

       SESSION, END
              Start/end  a  clamd session which will allow you to run multiple
              commands per TCP session. It's recommended to prefix clamd  com-
              mands with the letter n (eg. nSCAN) to indicate that the command
              will be delimited by a newline character and that  clamd  should
              continue  reading command data until a newline is read. The new-
              line delimiter assures that the complete command and its  entire
              argument will be processed as a single command.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number and exit.

       -c FILE, --config-file=FILE
              Read configuration from FILE.

FILES
       /private/etc/clamd.conf
