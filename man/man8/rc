RC(8)                     BSD System Manager's Manual                    RC(8)

NAME
     rc -- command script for boot

SYNOPSIS
     rc
     rc.local

DESCRIPTION
     Prior to Mac OS X 10.5, the rc script was used to bootstrap the OS. As of
     Leopard, the system is self-bootstrapped via launchd(8) which uses the
     launchctl(1) bootstrap subcommand to read in launchd jobs from the stan-
     dard locations.  For compatibility reasons, the rc.local script still
     continues to work.

     The startup file rc.local reside in /etc.
