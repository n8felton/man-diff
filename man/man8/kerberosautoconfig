NAME
     kerberosautoconfig -- Kerberos -- Open Directory Single Sign On

SYNOPSIS
     kerberosautoconfig [-f directory_node] [-o output_dir]
                        [-r realm_name -m master_kdc] [-u] [-k]
                        [-v debug_level]

DESCRIPTION
     The kerberosautoconfig command creates the edu.mit.Kerberos file from
     information stored in the open directory config record named Ker-
     berosClient. The existing edu.mit.Kerberos file is only replaced if the
     autogenerated header is present and the generation_id in the Ker-
     berosClient config record is greater than that within the file. The
     default location of the output file is /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Ker-
     beros. If the machine is standalone, this command will do nothing (unless
     the -u option is used) Defifintions

     directory_node
              An open directory node path specifier. Such as /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1

     output_dir
              The directory in which kerberosautoconfig deposits the
              edu.mit.Kerberos file

     realm_name
              Name of the Kerberos realm that will be the default when creat-
              ing a file from scratch

     master_kdc
              Host name of the master KDC for the default realm when creating
              a file from scratch

     debug_level
              Specifies the amount of debugging information printed to stdout,
              default is 1

     Flags:

     -f       Tells kerberosautoconfig to look in the specified open directory
              node for the KerberosClient config record.

     -o       Specifies the directory in which kerberosautoconfig will write
              the new edu.mit.Kerberos file into

     -r       kerberosautoconfig can create an edu.mit.Kerberos file from
              information passed on the command line. Use the -r and -m flags
              to specify the default realm and master KDC for that realm.

     -m       See above

     -k       Adds the default Kerberos logging directives to the config file
              (useful when setting up a kdc)

     -u       Forces an update of the file. Will overwrite an existing non-
              autogenerated edu.mit.Kerberos file.  Use with caution.

     -v       Specifies the amount of debugging information printed to stdout,
              default is 1

FILES
     /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos         The main Kerberos config
                                                   file (also known as
                                                   krb5.conf on other systems)

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     kerberosautoconfig looks for the KerberosClient config record in each of
     the open directory nodes on the search path. It merges the realm informa-
     tion from any KerberosClient config records it finds, but it only checks
     the generation_id from the first config record found. This means that the
     file does not get updated if the second KerberosClient record found
     changes.

HISTORY
     kerberosautoconfig first appeared in Mac OS X 10.3
