KADMIND(8)                                                          KADMIND(8)



NAME
       kadmind - KADM5 administration server

SYNOPSIS
       kadmind [-x db_args] [-r realm] [-m] [-nofork] [-port port-number]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  starts the KADM5 administration server.  If the database
       is db2, the administration server runs on the master  Kerberos  server,
       which  stores the KDC prinicpal database and the KADM5 policy database.
       If the database is LDAP, the administration server and the  KDC  server
       need  not  run on the same machine.  Kadmind accepts remote requests to
       administer the information in these  databases.   Remote  requests  are
       sent,  for  example,  by  kadmin(8) and the kpasswd(1) command, both of
       which are clients of kadmind.

       kadmind requires a number of configuration files to be set up in  order
       for it to work:

       kdc.conf  The  KDC configuration file contains configuration informatin
                 for the KDC and the KADM5 system.  Kadmind understands a num-
                 ber  of  variable  settings  in  this  file, some of whch are
                 mandatory and some of which are optional.  See the CONFIGURA-
                 TION VALUES section below.

       keytab    Kadmind  requires a keytab containing correct entries for the
                 kadmin/admin and kadmin/changepw principals for  every  realm
                 that  kadmind  will  answer  requests for.  The keytab can be
                 created with the  kadmin(8)  client.   The  location  of  the
                 keytab  is determined by the admin_keytab configuration vari-
                 able (see CONFIGURATION VALUES).

       ACL file  Kadmind's ACL (access control list) tells it which principals
                 are  allowed  to  perform  KADM5 administration actions.  The
                 path of the ACL file is specified via the acl_file configura-
                 tion  variable (see CONFIGURATION VALUES).  The syntax of the
                 ACL file is specified in the ACL FILE SYNTAX section below.

       After the server begins running, it puts itself in the  background  and
       disassociates itself from its controlling terminal.

OPTIONS
       -x db_args
              specifies the database specific arguments.

              Options supported for LDAP database are:

                   -x nconns=<number_of_connections>
                   specifies  the  number  of connections to be maintained per
                   LDAP server.

                   -x host=<ldapuri>
                   specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI.

                   -x binddn=<binddn>
                   specifies the DN of the object used by  the  administration
                   server to bind to the LDAP server.  This object should have
                   the read and write rights on the realm container, principal
                   container  and the subtree that is referenced by the realm.

                   -x bindpwd=<bind_password>
                   specifies the password for the above mentioned  binddn.  It
                   is  recommended not to use this option.  Instead, the pass-
                   word  can  be  stashed  using  the  stashsrvpw  command  of
                   kdb5_ldap_util.

       -r realm
              specifies  the  default  realm that kadmind will serve; if it is
              not specified, the default realm of the host is  used.   kadmind
              will  answer requests for any realm that exists in the local KDC
              database and for which the appropriate  principals  are  in  its
              keytab.

       -m     specifies  that  the  master database password should be fetched
              from the keyboard rather than from a file on  disk.   Note  that
              the  server  gets  the  password  prior to putting itself in the
              background; in combination with the  -nofork  option,  you  must
              place it in the background by hand.

       -nofork
              specifies  that the server does not put itself in the background
              and does not disassociate itself from the terminal.   In  normal
              operation,  you  should  always allow the server place itself in
              the background.

       -port port-number
              specifies the port on which the  administration  server  listens
              for  connections.   The  default  is  is  controlled by the kad-
              mind_port configuration variable (see below).

CONFIGURATION VALUES
       In addition to the relations defined  in  kdc.conf(5),  kadmind  under-
       stands  the  following  relations,  all  of  which should appear in the
       [realms] section:

       acl_file
              The path of kadmind's ACL file.  Mandatory.  No default.

       dict_file
              The path of kadmind's password dictionary.  A principal with any
              password  policy  will  not be allowed to select any password in
              the dictionary.  Optional.  No default.

       admin_keytab
              The name of the keytab containing  entries  for  the  principals
              kadmin/admin and kadmin/changepw in each realm that kadmind will
              serve.  The default is the value of the KRB5_KTNAME  environment
              variable, if defined.  Mandatory.

       kadmind_port
              The  TCP port on which kadmind will listen.  The default is 749.

ACL FILE SYNTAX
       The ACL file controls which principals  can  or  cannot  perform  which
       administrative  functions.   For operations that affect principals, the
       ACL file also controls which principals  can  operate  on  which  other
       principals.   This  file can contain comment lines, null lines or lines
       which contain ACL entries.  Comment lines start with the sharp sign (#)
       and  continue  until the end of the line.  Lines containing ACL entries
       have the format  of  principal  whitespace  operation-mask  [whitespace
       operation-target]

       Ordering  is important.  The first matching entry is the one which will
       control access for a particular principal on a particular principal.


       principal
              may specify a partially or fully qualified  Kerberos  version  5
              principal  name.   Each  component of the name may be wildcarded
              using the asterisk ( * ) character.

       operation-target
              [Optional] may specify a partially or fully  qualified  Kerberos
              version  5  principal  name.   Each component of the name may be
              wildcarded using the asterisk ( * ) character.

       operation-mask
              Specifies what operations may or may not be peformed by a  prin-
              cipal  matching  a particular entry.  This is a string of one or
              more of the following list of  characters  or  their  upper-case
              counterparts.   If  the character is upper-case, then the opera-
              tion is disallowed.  If the character is  lower-case,  then  the
              operation is permitted.

              a    [Dis]allows  the  addition of principals or policies in the
                   database.
              d    [Dis]allows the deletion of principals or policies  in  the
                   database.
              m    [Dis]allows  the  modification of principals or policies in
                   the database.
              c    [Dis]allows the changing of passwords for principals in the
                   database.
              i    [Dis]allows inquiries to the database.
              l    [Dis]allows  the  listing  of principals or policies in the
                   database.
              x    Short for admcil.
              *    Same as x.
       Some examples of valid entries here are:

       user/instance@realm adm
              A  standard  fully  qualified  name.   The  operation-mask  only
              applies  to  this  principal  and  specifies that [s]he may add,
              delete or modify principals and policies, but not change anybody
              else's password.

       user/instance@realm cim service/instance@realm
              A  standard  fully qualified name and a standard fully qualified
              target.  The operation-mask only applies to this principal oper-
              ating  on  this  target  and specifies that [s]he may change the
              target's password, request information about the target and mod-
              ify it.

       user/*@realm ac
              A wildcarded name.  The operation-mask applies to all principals
              in realm "realm" whose first component is "user"  and  specifies
              that [s]he may add principals and change anybody's password.

       user/*@realm i */instance@realm
              A wildcarded name and target.  The operation-mask applies to all
              principals in realm "realm" whose first component is "user"  and
              specifies  that  [s]he may perform inquiries on principals whose
              second component is "instance" and realm is "realm".

FILES
       principal.db        default name for Kerberos principal database

       <dbname>.kadm5      KADM5  administrative  database.   (This  would  be
                           "principal.kadm5",  if you use the default database
                           name.)  Contains policy information.

       <dbname>.kadm5.lock lock file for the  KADM5  administrative  database.
                           This  file  works  backwards  from  most other lock
                           files.  I.e., kadmin will exit  with  an  error  if
                           this file does not exist.

       Note:               The above three files are specific to db2 database.

       kadm5.acl           file containing list of principals and their kadmin
                           administrative   privileges.    See   above  for  a
                           description.

       kadm5.keytab        keytab file for kadmin/admin principal.

       kadm5.dict          file containing dictionary  of  strings  explicitly
                           disallowed as passwords.
