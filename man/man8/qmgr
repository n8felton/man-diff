NAME
       qmgr - Postfix queue manager

SYNOPSIS
       qmgr [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The qmgr(8) daemon awaits the arrival of incoming mail and arranges for
       its delivery via Postfix delivery processes.  The actual  mail  routing
       strategy  is  delegated to the trivial-rewrite(8) daemon.  This program
       expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.

       Mail addressed to the local double-bounce address is  logged  and  dis-
       carded.   This  stops  potential  loops  caused by undeliverable bounce
       notifications.

MAIL QUEUES
       The qmgr(8) daemon maintains the following queues:

       incoming
              Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up  by  the  local
              pickup(8) daemon from the maildrop directory.

       active Messages  that the queue manager has opened for delivery. Only a
              limited number of messages is allowed to enter the active  queue
              (leaky bucket strategy, for a fixed delivery rate).

       deferred
              Mail  that  could  not  be delivered upon the first attempt. The
              queue manager implements exponential  backoff  by  doubling  the
              time between delivery attempts.

       corrupt
              Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here for inspection.

       hold   Messages that are kept "on hold" are  kept  here  until  someone
              sets them free.

DELIVERY STATUS REPORTS
       The  qmgr(8) daemon keeps an eye on per-message delivery status reports
       in the following directories. Each status report file has the same name
       as the corresponding message file:

       bounce Per-recipient  status  information  about  why  mail is bounced.
              These files are maintained by the bounce(8) daemon.

       defer  Per-recipient status information  about  why  mail  is  delayed.
              These files are maintained by the defer(8) daemon.

       trace  Per-recipient  status  information as requested with the Postfix
              "sendmail -v" or "sendmail -bv" command.  These files are  main-
              tained by the trace(8) daemon.

       The qmgr(8) daemon is responsible for asking the bounce(8), defer(8) or
       trace(8) daemons to send delivery reports.

STRATEGIES
       The queue manager implements a variety of strategies for either opening
       queue files (input) or for message delivery (output).

       leaky bucket
              This  strategy limits the number of messages in the active queue
              and prevents the queue manager from running out of memory  under
              heavy load.

       fairness
              When the active queue has room, the queue manager takes one mes-
              sage from the incoming queue and one from  the  deferred  queue.
              This prevents a large mail backlog from blocking the delivery of
              new mail.

       slow start
              This strategy eliminates "thundering herd"  problems  by  slowly
              adjusting the number of parallel deliveries to the same destina-
              tion.

       round robin
              The  queue  manager  sorts  delivery  requests  by  destination.
              Round-robin  selection  prevents one destination from dominating
              deliveries to other destinations.

       exponential backoff
              Mail  that  cannot  be  delivered  upon  the  first  attempt  is
              deferred.   The  time interval between delivery attempts is dou-
              bled after each attempt.

       destination status cache
              The queue manager avoids unnecessary delivery attempts by  main-
              taining  a  short-term,  in-memory  list of unreachable destina-
              tions.

       preemptive message scheduling
              The queue manager attempts to minimize the average per-recipient
              delay  while  still  preserving  the correct per-message delays,
              using a sophisticated preemptive message scheduling.

TRIGGERS
       On an idle system, the queue manager waits for the arrival  of  trigger
       events, or it waits for a timer to go off. A trigger is a one-byte mes-
       sage.  Depending on the message received, the  queue  manager  performs
       one  of  the following actions (the message is followed by the symbolic
       constant used internally by the software):

       D (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED)
              Start a deferred queue  scan.   If  a  deferred  queue  scan  is
              already  in  progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it
              finishes.

       I (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING)
              Start an incoming queue scan.  If  an  incoming  queue  scan  is
              already  in  progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it
              finishes.

       A (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL)
              Ignore deferred queue file time stamps. The request affects  the
              next deferred queue scan.

       F (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD)
              Purge all information about dead transports and destinations.

       W (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP)
              Wakeup  call,  This  is used by the master server to instantiate
              servers that should not go away forever. The action is to  start
              an incoming queue scan.

       The  qmgr(8) daemon reads an entire buffer worth of triggers.  Multiple
       identical trigger requests are collapsed into one, and trigger requests
       are  sorted  so that A and F precede D and I. Thus, in order to force a
       deferred queue run, one would request A F D; in  order  to  notify  the
       queue manager of the arrival of new mail one would request I.

STANDARDS
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)
       RFC 3464 (Delivery status notifications)

SECURITY
       The qmgr(8) daemon is not security sensitive. It reads single-character
       messages from untrusted local users, and thus  may  be  susceptible  to
       denial of service attacks. The qmgr(8) daemon does not talk to the out-
       side world, and it can be run at fixed  low  privilege  in  a  chrooted
       environment.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems  and  transactions are logged to the syslog daemon.  Corrupted
       message files are saved to the corrupt queue for further inspection.

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the  postmas-
       ter is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

BUGS
       A single queue manager process has to compete for disk access with mul-
       tiple front-end processes such as cleanup(8). A sudden burst of inbound
       mail can negatively impact outbound delivery rates.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically as qmgr(8) is a per-
       sistent process. Use the "postfix reload" command after a configuration
       change.

       The  text  below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.
