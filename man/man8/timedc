TIMEDC(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                TIMEDC(8)

NAME
     timedc -- timed control program

SYNOPSIS
     timedc [command [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     The timedc utility is used to control the operation of the timed(8) pro-
     gram.  It may be used to:

     o   Measure the differences between machines' clocks,

     o   Find the location where the master time server is running,

     o   Enable or disable tracing of messages received by timed(8), and

     o   Perform various debugging actions.

     Without any arguments, timedc will prompt for commands from the standard
     input.  If arguments are supplied, timedc interprets the first argument
     as a command and the remaining arguments as parameters to the command.
     The standard input may be redirected causing timedc to read commands from
     a file.  Commands may be abbreviated; recognized commands are:

     ? [command ...]

     help [command ...]
             Print a short description of each command specified in the argu-
             ment list, or, if no arguments are given, a list of the recog-
             nized commands.

     clockdiff host ...
             Compute the differences between the clock of the host machine and
             the clocks of the machines given as arguments.

     msite [host ...]
             Show the master time server for specified host(s).

     trace { on | off }
             Enable or disable the tracing of incoming messages to timed in
             the file /var/log/timed.log.

     election host1 [host2 ...]
             Asks the daemon on the target host to reset its "election" timers
             and to ensure that a time master has been elected.

     quit    Exit from timedc.

     Other commands may be included for use in testing and debugging timed(8);
     the help command and the program source may be consulted for details.
