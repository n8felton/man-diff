YPSET(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 YPSET(8)

NAME
     ypset -- tell ypbind(8) which YP server process to use

SYNOPSIS
     ypset [-h host] [-d domain] server

DESCRIPTION
     Ypset tells the ypbind(8) process on the current machine which YP server
     process to communicate with.  If server is down or is not running a YP
     server process, it is not discovered until a YP client process attempts
     to access a YP map, at which time ypbind(8) tests the binding and takes
     appropriate action.

     Ypset is most useful for binding a YP client that is not on the same
     broadcast network as the closest YP server, but can also be used for
     debugging a local network's YP configuration, testing specific YP client
     programs, or binding to a specific server when there are many servers on
     the local network supplying YP maps.

     The options are as follows:

     -h host
             Set the YP binding on host instead of the local machine.

     -d domain
             Use the YP domain domain instead of the default domain as
             returned by domainname(1).
