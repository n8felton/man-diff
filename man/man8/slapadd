SLAPADD(8C)                                                        SLAPADD(8C)



NAME
       slapadd - Add entries to a SLAPD database

SYNOPSIS
       /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-106~5/Root/usr/sbin/slapadd   [-v]  [-c]
       [-g] [-u] [-q] [-w] [-d level] [-b suffix] [-n dbnum]  [-f  slapd.conf]
       [-F confdir] [-l ldif-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapadd  is used to add entries specified in LDAP Directory Interchange
       Format (LDIF) to a slapd(8) database.   It  opens  the  given  database
       determined  by  the  database  number or suffix and adds entries corre-
       sponding to the provided LDIF to the database.  Databases configured as
       subordinate  of this one are also updated, unless -g is specified.  The
       LDIF input is read from standard input or the specified file.

       As slapadd is designed to accept LDIF in database order, as produced by
       slapcat(8),  it  does  not  verify  that  superior entries exist before
       adding an entry, does not perform all user and  system  schema  checks,
       and  does  not maintain operational attributes (such as createTimeStamp
       and modifiersName).

OPTIONS
       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -c     enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -u     enable dry-run (don't write to backend) mode.

       -q     enable  quick (fewer integrity checks) mode.  Does fewer consis-
              tency checks on the input data, and no consistency  checks  when
              writing  the database.  Improves the load time but if any errors
              or interruptions occur the resulting database will be  unusable.

       -w     write  syncrepl  context  information.   After  all  entries are
              added, the contextCSN will be updated with the greatest  CSN  in
              the database.

       -d level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified level.

       -b suffix
              Use  the  specified  suffix  to  determine which database to add
              entries to.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction  with  the  -n
              option.

       -n dbnum
              Add entries to the dbnum-th database listed in the configuration
              file.  The -n cannot be used in conjunction with the -b  option.

       -f slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F confdir
              specify  a  config  directory.  If both -f and -F are specified,
              the config file will be read and converted to  config  directory
              format  and  written  to  the  specified  directory.  If neither
              option is specified, an  attempt  to  read  the  default  config
              directory  will  be made before trying to use the default config
              file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config
              file is ignored. If dryrun mode is also specified, no conversion
              will occur.

       -l ldif-file
              Read LDIF from the specified file instead of standard input.

LIMITATIONS
       Your slapd(8) should not be running when you do this to ensure  consis-
       tency of the database.

       slapadd  may  not  provide naming or schema checks.  It is advisable to
       use ldapadd(1) when adding new entries into an existing directory.

EXAMPLES
       To import the entries specified in file ldif into your  slapd(8)  data-
       base give the command:

            /BinaryCache/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-106~5/Root/usr/sbin/slapadd -l ldif
