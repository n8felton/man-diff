SYNC(8)                   BSD System Manager's Manual                  SYNC(8)

NAME
     sync -- force completion of pending disk writes (flush cache)

SYNOPSIS
     sync

DESCRIPTION
     Sync can be called to insure that all disk writes have been completed
     before the processor is halted in a way not suitably done by reboot(8) or
     halt(8).  Generally, it is preferable to use reboot or halt to shut down
     the system, as they may perform additional actions such as resynchroniz-
     ing the hardware clock and flushing internal caches before performing a
     final sync.

     Sync utilizes the sync(2) function call.

SEE ALSO
     fsync(2), sync(2), halt(8), reboot(8), update(8)

HISTORY
     A sync command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
