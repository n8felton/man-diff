NAME
     pam_serialnumber -- Authentication for remote installation of Mac OS X
     Server module for PAM

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_serialnumber [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The authentication for remote installation of Mac OS X Server module for
     PAM, pam_serialnumber, provides simple root authentication for the remote
     installation and setup of Mac OS X Server.  It does so by authenticating
     the root user with a password matching the first eight characters of the
     authenticating computer's serial number.

     The module will only authenticate if the filesystem root, ``/'', is
     mounted as read-only.

     If the serial number can not be read, for whatever reason, authenticating
     with the password "12345678" will be allowed instead.

     This authentication modules is intended to only be used with Mac OS X
     Server installation and setup.  Any other usage may be a security risk
     and is not recommended.
