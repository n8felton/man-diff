autobind(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              autobind(8)

NAME
     autobind

SYNOPSIS
     autobind

DESCRIPTION
     The autobind tool is used to automatically set the DHCP directory binding
     options if they have not yet been explicitly set. This is run from a tem-
     porary startup item when upgrading from an earlier version of Mac OS X
     which did not explicitly set the DHCP binding setting during the Setup
     Assistant.

     The policy used by autobind is to explictly disable DHCP directory bind-
     ing if no directory servers are available from DHCP at the time it is
     run. If one or more servers is available then the DHCP binding is explic-
     itly enabled.

     autobind must be run as root to make changes to the directory binding
     settings.
