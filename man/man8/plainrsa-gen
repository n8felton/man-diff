PLAINRSA-GEN(8)           BSD System Manager's Manual          PLAINRSA-GEN(8)

NAME
     plainrsa-gen -- generator for Plain RSA keys

SYNOPSIS
     plainrsa-gen [-b bits] [-e pubexp] [-f outfile] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     plainrsa-gen can be used to generate Plain RSA keys for authentication
     purposes.  Using Plain RSA keys is optional.  Other possibilities are
     Pre-shared keys or X.509 certificates.

     -b bits
             bit length of the key.  Default is 1024, recommended length is
             2048 or even 4096 bits.  Note that generating longer keys takes
             more time.

     -e pubexp
             value of the RSA public exponent.  Default is 0x3.  Don't change
             this unless you really know what you are doing!

     -f outfile
             write the resulting key to outfile instead of stdout.  If the
             file already exists it won't be overwritten.  You wouldn't like
             to lose your private key by accident, would you?

OUTPUT FILE FORMAT
     This is the secret private key that should never leave your computer:

     : RSA   {
             # RSA 1024 bits
             # pubkey=0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
             Modulus: 0xab5a57306c021d3523...
             PublicExponent: 0x03
             PrivateExponent: 0x723c3a2048...
             Prime1: 0xd309b30e6adf9d85c01...
             Prime2: 0xcfdc2a8aa5b2b3c90e3...
             Exponent1: 0x8cb122099c9513ae...
             Exponent2: 0x8a92c7071921cd30...
             Coefficient: 0x722751305eafe9...
       }

     The line pubkey=0sAQOrW... of the private key contains a public key that
     should be stored in the other peer's configuration in this format:

     : PUB 0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...

     You can also specify from and to addresses for which the key is valid:

     0.0.0.0/0 10.20.30.0/24 : PUB 0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
