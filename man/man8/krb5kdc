NAME
       krb5kdc - Kerberos V5 KDC

SYNOPSIS
       krb5kdc  [  -a ] [ -x db_args ] [ -d dbname ] [ -k keytype ] [ -M mkey-
       name ] [ -p portnum ] [ -m ] [ -r realm ] [ -4 v4mode ] [ -n ]

DESCRIPTION
       krb5kdc is the Kerberos version 5 Authentication Service and  Key  Dis-
       tribution Center (AS/KDC).

       The -a option enables Apple Password Server integration.

       The -x db_args option specifies the database specific arguments.

       Options supported for LDAP database are:

               -x nconns=<number_of_connections>
               specifies  the  number of connections to be maintained per LDAP
               server.

               -x host=<ldapuri>
               specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI.

               -x binddn=<binddn>
               specifies the DN of the object used by the KDC server  to  bind
               to the LDAP server.  This object should have the rights to read
               the realm container, principal container and the  subtree  that
               is referenced by the realm.

               -x bindpwd=<bind_password>
               specifies  the  password  for the above mentioned binddn. It is
               recommended not to use this option.  Instead, the password  can
               be stashed using the stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util.

       The  -r  realm  option  specifies the realm for which the server should
       provide    service;    by    default    the    realm    returned     by
       krb5_default_local_realm(3) is used.

       The -d dbname option specifies the name under which the principal data-
       base can be found; by default  the  database  is  in  DEFAULT_DBM_FILE.
       This option does not apply to the LDAP database.

       The  -k  keytype option specifies the key type of the master key in the
       database; the default is KEYTYPE_DES.

       The -M mkeyname option specifies the principal name for the master  key
       in  the  database; the default is KRB5_KDB_M_NAME (usually "K/M" in the
       KDC's realm).

       The -p portnum option specifies the default UDP port number  which  the
       KDC  should  listen  on for Kerberos version 5 requests.  This value is
       used when no port is specified in the KDC profile and when no  port  is
       specified  in  the  Kerberos configuration file.  If no value is avail-
       able, then the value in /etc/services for service "kerberos" is used.

       The -m option specifies that the master  database  password  should  be
       fetched from the keyboard rather than from a file on disk.

       The  -4  option  specifies how the KDC responds to kerberos IV requests
       for tickets.  The command line option overrides the value  in  the  KDC
       profile.   The  possible  values  are none, disable, full or nopreauth.
       These instruct the KDC to not respond to V4 packets, to respond with  a
       version  skew  error, to issue tickets for all database entries, and to
       issue tickets for all but preauthentication required  database  entries
       respectively. The default behaviour is as if none was specified.

       The  -n  option specifies that the KDC does not put itself in the back-
       ground and does not disassociate itself from the terminal.   In  normal
       operation, you should always allow the KDC to place itself in the back-
       ground.

       The KDC may service requests for multiple realms (maximum  32  realms).
       The  realms are listed on the command line.  Per-realm options that can
       be specified on the command line pertain for each realm that follows it
       and  are  superceded by subsequent definitions of the same option.  For
       example,

       krb5kdc -p 2001 -r REALM1 -p 2002 -r REALM2 -r REALM3

       specifies that the KDC listen on port 2001 for REALM1 and on port  2002
       for REALM2 and REALM3.  Additionally, per-realm parameters may be spec-
       ified in the kdc.conf file.  The location of this file may be specified
       by  the KRB5_KDC_PROFILE environment variable.  Parameters specified in
       this file take precedence over options specified on the  command  line.
       See the kdc.conf(5) description for further details.

BUGS
       It  should fork and go into the background when it finishes reading the
       master password from the terminal.
