AUTOFSD(8)                BSD System Manager's Manual               AUTOFSD(8)

NAME
     autofsd -- daemon to update autofs mounts on network changes

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/autofsd

DESCRIPTION
     autofsd runs automount(8), and then waits for network configuration
     change events and, when such an event occurs, re-runs automount(8) to
     update the mounts to reflect the current automounter maps.  It can also
     be signalled by automount_reread(8) to run automount(8).

SEE ALSO
     automount(8), automount_reread(8), automountd(8), configd(8)
