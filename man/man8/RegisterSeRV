RegisterSeRV(8)           BSD System Manager's Manual          RegisterSeRV(8)

NAME
     RegisterSeRV -- Mac OS X serial number registration tool

SYNOPSIS
     RegisterSeRV [-d] [-s]
     RegisterSeRV [-h | -v]

DESCRIPTION
     RegisterSeRV communicates with serialnumberd(8) to register saved serial
     numbers during the boot process.

     RegisterSeRV is not intended to be invoked manually, but it may be exe-
     cuted by the super-user if there was an issue with serial number regis-
     trations.

OPTIONS
     The following options are available:
     -d, --debug    Print some potentially helpful log strings to the termi-
                    nal.

     -h, --help     Print usage summary and exit.

     -s, --sleep    Sleep for one second between registrations.

     -v, --version  Print build version and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The RegisterSeRV utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     RegisterSeRV must be executed as root.  Because RegisterSeRV controls
     system-wide resources, it must be executed by the root user.
